# Privacy Policy

Justin Hartman ("I", "us", "we", or "our") operates [justinhartman.blog][me] (the "Site"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information I receive from users of the Site.

I use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the Site. By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection And Use

While using my Site, I may ask you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name or email address ("Personal Information").

## Log Data

Like many site operators, I collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit my Site ("Log Data").

This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of my Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.

In addition, I may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyse this. This data may further extend into a third party service such as Google AdWords whereby I may use this information to better target adverts tailored to your specific needs. 

Nothing of an identifiable nature will be shared across third party services and your Personal Information is always safe from being shared with third parties.

## Communications

I may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that I may deem to be in the best interests of sharing with you. I hope that my communication never imposes on you or becomes too much information but I also don't want to neglect people who want to hear more from myself.

My communication with you will always be by your consent only. You will never be opted into various newsletters and marketing fluff; you would have to want to and agree to be a part of any communication from me. I will never send you unsolicited communication.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive.

Like many sites, I use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of my Site.

[My Cookies Policy][cookie-policy] explains what cookies are, how I use cookies, how third-parties I may partner with may use cookies on my website, your choices regarding cookies and further information about cookies. 

## Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of _21 March 2018_ and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically to see if there are any changes. At the top of this page there is a last updated time-stamp labelled "**Updated on:**" which will always reflect the last time this policy was updated since _21 March 2018_.

Your continued use of the Service after I post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgement of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.

If I make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, I will notify you either through the email address you have provided me, or by placing a prominent notice on my website.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, [please contact me][github].
