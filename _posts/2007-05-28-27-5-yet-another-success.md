excerpt: One of the first things Nic Haralambous had to say to me on arrival at the 27dinner was - <em>why are you not at home working?</em> My response was quite simply that once every two months I take a night off to socialise and interact with like-minded Geeks and last night was no different.

One of the first things <a href="http://nicharalambous.com/">Nic Haralambous</a> had to say to me on arrival at the <a href="http://27dinner.pbwiki.com/">27dinner</a> was - <em>why are you not at home working?</em> My response was quite simply that once every two months I take a night off to socialise and interact with like-minded Geeks and last night was no different.

It's only my second 27dinner but I have to admit that I really look forward to these Geek gatherings as it gives me an opportunity to chat with all these virtual users in a real-world kind of way. 

I had some awesome chats with <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/desousa">Paul de Sousa</a>, <a href="http://www.vinnylingham.com/">Vinny Lingham</a> (who despite having such a HUGE reputation is actually such a down-to-earth guy), <a href="http://vincentmaher.com">Vincent Maher</a>, <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/">Colin Daniels</a>, <a href="http://how-to-become-a-serial-dater.blogspot.com/">Susan Deysel</a> (who couldn't remember me for love or money) and the infamous Erik Hersman who is more commonly know as the <a href="http://www.whiteafrican.com/">White African</a>.

Colin gave us an interesting debriefing on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2445995529">Bullardgate</a> while Erik really drilled home mobile phone usage as a medium to deliver content to users and finally Vinny made his <a href="http://www.vinnylingham.com/2007/05/the-road-ahead-for-me.html">big announcement</a>.

Last night also gave us an opportunity to hand out the <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2007/04/26/win-an-apple-ipod-with-afrigator/">Limited Edition T-Shirts</a> so I really hope everyone who got one is happy with them!

Once again thanks to <a href="http://daveduarte.co.za">Dave</a> and <a href="http://mikestopforth.com">Mike</a> from <a href="http://www.cerebra.co.za">Cerebra</a> for organising, paying and hosting the event and a special thanks to Mike for <strike>eventually</strike> remembering to give me a lift home!
