Well it's official - I'm no longer a virgin and my first introduction into the <em>real-world</em> geek community was fab. At first glance the <a href="http://27dinner.pbwiki.com/">27dinner</a> can be a little overwhelming however when you actually start introducing yourself to people it's amazing to see how many people you actually know - even if just virtually.

Lots has been written about this unique 27dinner thing and I unfortunately don't have anything unique to add to the discussion apart from the fact that I enjoyed myself immensely. I never really thought meeting this virtual lot could actually be such fun!
