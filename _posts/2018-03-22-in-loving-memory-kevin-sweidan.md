It's that time of year again when I remember that horrible day on September 15th 2003 when my best friend and business partner, Kevin Sweidan, passed away so horribly. Yesterday was two years since that Monday when we found his body and in fairness I think this second year has been tougher on me emotionally than the first year. I remember clearly how this time last year I really felt the loss of Kevin but somehow this year the build-up since about August has been the toughest.

Kevin - wherever you are, you are sorely missed my friend and the hole that has existed since you left this world two years ago still very much remains void and empty. I miss your charming nature and kind and gentle way but most of all I miss my best friend who was there for me through thick and thin. We had good times and we had bad and your passing has taught me never to take anyone for granted every again. Time is short and never on our side but those last six months together were the best times of my life.

I thank you, I miss you, I love you.
