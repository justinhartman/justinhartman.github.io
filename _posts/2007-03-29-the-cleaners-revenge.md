excerpt: So there's this really cool clip I came across yesterday on the Twac website which I thought I have to share with you. It lacks a little plot and is a little silly but the technique is brilliant.

So there's this really cool clip I came across yesterday on the <a href="http://www.twac.co.za">Twac</a> website which I thought I have to share with you. It lacks a little plot and is a little silly but the technique is brilliant. The clip below was shot using still photos and more than 450 pics were taken to create this effect. 

The result - <strong>brilliant!</strong>

>The video is no longer available. Apologies for this.
