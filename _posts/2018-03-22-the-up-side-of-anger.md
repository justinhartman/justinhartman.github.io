It's been a while since I last posted something on the blog and with good reason. The last month and a bit I've been hectic with adding new services to <a href="http://www.hartpro.com/">Hartman Productions</a> and also getting the business more automated.

I've introduced a new billing and signup system which, to say the least, has given me loads of grey hairs and sleepless nights. A part of this new system was to integrate a SSL certificate onto the domain and I don't really want to bore you so to cut a long story short after nearly two weeks of downtime I decided to revert back to all the old settings.

Our primary domain www.hpcc.co.za was the one that was affected by this change so after much anger, frustration and loss of income all new signups and billing will now handled via the www.hartpro.com domain name.

For some bizarre reason our .co.za domain names in this country is just not what it should be and it makes me angry to say the least. With a .com domain changes are effective within a few hours while with .co.za it takes 3 days minimum. It is amazing the amount of time I've wasted trying to get things to work that should ultimately just work from day one. Our domain registry should really look at trying to implement something similar to .com domains...

The upside to all my frustration the last few weeks has been that once again I've learned a hell of a lot about what not to do when automating your business. I can finally say that my new billing and signup system is running well and is already saving us a lot of time by managing the accounts and new domain signups. This means there is more time to focus on the important things and less time on the not so important things.

The last week has also been difficult with sickness in my household. Both my wife and son have been sick all week and it's tough having both of them not feeling well. I started with a stomach bug earlier in the week but thankfully it went away as quick as it came. What concerns me is that with all the unhealthy germs flying around I feel it's probably only a matter of time before this affects me and I get sick like they have. I have observed that every year the flu/stomach bug always gets worse... feels like some strange impending doom waiting for us in the years to come :(

On the downside to things the <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/">English Premier League</a> season is coming to an end tomorrow. This is a very sad day for me as I'm not sure what I'll do with myself during the winter months. I am a huge <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/">Arsenal</a> fan and it saddens me to say we only finished 2nd this season which is a little below standard for us.

But never fear next Saturday is the big FA Cup final in which we take on those scum-bags Man United for what is going to be a clash of all clashes. I can't wait :)

I guess with soccer coming to an end I can get even more work done but all work and no play certainly makes Justin a very dull boy!!!!
