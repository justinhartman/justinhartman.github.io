excerpt: It's been a while since I last posted something on the blog and with good reason. The last month and a bit I've been hectic with adding new services to <a href="http://www.hartpro.com/">Hartman Productions</a> and also getting the business more automated.

Today marks the first official school day for my 16-month old son Luke. I have to admit it was a very emotional day particularly for me as it just shows how quickly these little ones grow up. If I had it my way I'd still have him fully-dependent on us but I guess we all have to grow up at some point.

The sad part is he didn't even miss his Mom and I at all and when we picked him up this afternoon he was all smiles playing on the school playground. I guess another chapter in my life begins and I look forward to the new challenges that lie ahead :)
