Today sees the launch of my new weekly contribution I'll be doing for <a href="http://sarocks.co.za/">SA Rocks</a>. <strong>Technology Thursday</strong>, will focus on South African technology and the impact it has on the world today. As South Africans we have created a vast array of technological innovations and will continue to do so and I'm privileged to pay homage to these achievements. 

In the spirit of humanity I've decided to kick off the column with a focus on the ever-popular desktop operating system, Ubuntu in my <a href="http://sarocks.co.za/wp-trackback.php?p=58">Linux for human beings</a> article. 

In only two short years and millions of users worldwide Ubuntu is a major player in the Linux world and Canonical, the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu, has been named one of the 'Top 20 Companies to Watch in 2007' by <a href="http://www.linuxmagazine.com/">Linux Magazine</a>. 

It was selected as one of the companies best positioned in the coming year to spur Linux and Open Source adoption, while delivering on the immediate needs of the market.
