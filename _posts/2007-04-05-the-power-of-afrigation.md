    to my vocabulary. Keep up the good work."

    to access the latest breaking news in an easy to use format.\r\n\r\n* Internet
    World stats show that Africa's penetration per population is only 3% of the entire
    world so it's a very small figure indeed. That said the growth rate between 2000-2007
    is 638.4% compared to the rest of the worlds growth rate of 203.2% growth rate.
    I think this is a very promising factor for Africa!!!"

With <a href="http://www.afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> only a couple days old I've already noticed the power of content Afrigation. This evening I was falling asleep on my couch (too many 5am work nights this week all thanks to <a href="http://www.afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>) and the 7pm news was on TV in the background.

Right at the end of the news broadcast the presenter butted in saying "This breaking news just in" and then duly reported on the resignation of Telkom CEO Papi Molotsane.

Now had SABC been watching the news on Afrigator they would have seen posts by <a href="http://mybroadband.co.za/nephp/?m=show&id=6093">MyADSL</a> at 17:18, <a href="http://www.fmtech.co.za/uncategorised/papi-molotsane-quits-telkom/">Financial Mail Tech</a> at 17:32 and <a href="http://crusoeeffect.blogspot.com/2007/04/shake-up-or-wake-up-at-telkom.html">The Crusoe Effect</a> at 18:28 all reporting this same story and maybe it wouldn't have been so breaking for the South African broadcaster.
