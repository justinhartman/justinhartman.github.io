Now I was one of the first to react to David Bullard's rant and I still maintain rightfully so however tonight I found an intersting twist to the Bullardgate campaign.
Sunday evening Vincent Maher <a href="http://vincentmaher.com/mit/?p=347">posted this</a> and asked us all to join the revolution by signing up to the Facebook group which he had created in protest which I diligently did. However, browsing my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=566420412">Facebook profile</a> tonight I realised that Vincent has left the very group he started:
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/05/picture-1.png' alt='Vincent Maher abandons his troops' />
I'm confused. How can the General abandon his troops right in the middle of the battle? Does this mean that Vincent has now revoked the whole Bullardgate campaign? At the time of writing this there are currently 64 supporters of which Vincent is no longer one of them so what sort of message does this carry to the rest of us?
At least <a href="http://davidbullard.wordpress.com/">Bullard</a> has stuck to his guns.
