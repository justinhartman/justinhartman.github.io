  content: Justin, the new site looks good and there's some really cool new features,
    which I think are of use to publishers and readers/"monitors" alike. Will users
    be able to share MyGator subscriptions on-site?

On a very cold and windy morning here in Johannesburg I'm comforted by the latest version we just released for <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>. I've done a very detailed blog post on the <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com">Afrigator Blog</a> so if you want to know what's changed <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2007/05/21/new-afrigator-launched/">find out here</a>.

We're also <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/competitions/">giving away two brand-spanking new iPod Videos</a> and if you haven't entered the competition you're clearly <strong>not a Geek</strong>!

Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts on our latest Alpha version so let me know.
