People say that this blogosphere is boring and to an extent I agree however I must admit I am finding some serious value in reading all the African blogs on <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>. Africa as a continent are really good writers and I particularly love North & West African political blogging views. My eyes have certainly opened to a whole new world.

Tonight on Afrigator I found this article written by Cameroonian blogger <a href="http://www.dibussi.com/">Dibussi Tande</a> which highlights the gory details of how Internet Mogul, Kevin Ham, worked with Cameroonian officials to make millions off domain typo-squatting. 

You can read the <a href="http://www.dibussi.com/2007/05/how_cameroon_au.html">full article here</a> but I have to say I'm amazed at the white-collar crime involved in the Internet domain space. 

According to Dibussi the plot was a simple yet effective one:

>In layman's terms, Cameroon Internet authorities were redirecting all misspelled .com addressed (e.g. www.dibussi.cm instead of www.dibussi.com ) to an advert-based website (agoga.com), where they were making millions of dollars in pay-per-click advert revenue (Pay-per-click is an advertising system where advertisers pay an agreed amount for each click delivered to their site).

I, like <a href="http://thetechie.co.za/?p=5">The Techie</a>, also thought this domain squatting business was a thing of the past but apparently where there is money to be made there will always be someone <strike>government</strike> who'll capitalise.

Ham, dubbed <em>The man who owns the Internet</em>, is estimated to be worth in excess of $300 million and his Cameroonian counter-parts are alleged to have received up to $3 million for their part in the conspiracy.
