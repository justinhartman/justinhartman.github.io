  content: "Justin, the difference between you and Bullard is as follows; \r\n\r\nyou
    - 'in one fowl swoop'\r\n\r\nBullard - In one fell swoop\r\n\r\nMeaning\r\n\r\nSuddenly;
    in a single action.\r\n\r\nOrigin\r\n\r\nThis is one of those phrases that we
    may have picked up early in our learning of the language and probably worked out
    its meaning from the context we heard it in, without any clear understanding of
    what each word meant. Most native English speakers could say what it means but,
    if we look at it out of context, it doesn't appear to make a great deal of sense.
    That lack of understanding of the words in the phrase is undoubtedly the reason
    that this is often misspelled - 'at one fail swoop' (or sometimes, stoop).\r\n\r\nSo,
    what's that 'fell'? We use the word in a variety of ways: to chop, as in fell
    a tree; a moorland or mountain, like those in the northern UK; the past tense
    of fall, as 'he fell over'. None of those seem to make sense in this phrase and
    indeed the 'fell' here is none of those. It's an old word, in use by the 13th
    century, that's now fallen out of use apart from in this phrase and as the common
    root of the term 'felon'. The Oxford English Dictionary defines fell as meaning
    'fierce, savage; cruel, ruthless; dreadful, terrible', which is pretty unambiguous.\r\n\r\nShakespeare
    either coined the phrase, or gave it circulation, in Macbeth, 1605:\r\n\r\nMACDUFF:
    [on hearing that his family and servants have all been killed]\r\n\r\nAll my pretty
    ones?\r\nDid you say all? O hell-kite! All?\r\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and
    their dam\r\nAt one fell swoop?"

    is that you cannot compare blogging to professional journalisim, it is like comparing

    who are paid, with good reason, to right columns. He has a strong opinion and
    I respect that, along with any other writing that he does because of his proffesional
    position. I will concede that not all people who are involved in blogging fit
    his discription, as i have previously mentioned, but he is right in saying that
    most blogs contain nonsence from people who think they can write a column but
    they are actually amateurs and poor writers with nothing better to do with their
    time. Theris no need for him to appologise. He is expressing his opinion which
    is a valid one.

  content: It is not a bigger step to put your name on such a comment.  The point
    is that you cannot compare blogging to professional journalisim, it is like comparing
    day and night. David Bullard and journalists like him are qualified professionals
    who are paid, with good reason, to right columns. He has a strong opinion and
    I respect that, along with any other writing that he does because of his proffesional
    position. I will concede that not all people who are involved in blogging fit
    his discription, as i have previously mentioned, but he is right in saying that
    most blogs contain nonsence from people who think they can write a column but
    they are actually amateurs and poor writers with nothing better to do with their
    time. Theris no need for him to appologise. He is expressing his opinion which
    is a valid one.

If you haven't read it already David Bullard, Sunday Times journalist and holier than thou author, has published <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.co.za/Columnists/DavidBullard/Article.aspx?id=452352">an article today in the Sunday Times</a> attacking the entire 70 million strong blogosphere.

My good friend Vincent Maher has <a href="http://vincentmaher.com/mit/?p=347">hit hard at Bullard</a> and rightly so and I support him and the entire blogosphere 100% in the demand of a public apology by the Sunday Times.

My quote on Vincent Maher's blog:

>I always had the utmost respect for Bullard but now I have to say - what an utter, mindless, self-serving wanker. That gun-shot wound has simply opened the moronic floodgates.

How the Sunday Times can endorse this rubbish and pay Bullard for writing such drivel is beyond me. Support the plight and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2445995529">join the facebook group</a>.

The ultimate reason why this article has pissed me off is because Bullard is simply negating the entire blogosphere in one fell swoop and portraying a negative outlook to his readers who probably don't even understand what blogging is. My entire effort on <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> the last month or so is meaningless since his readers now think we're all axe murders.

If he bothered to do a little research he'd find out that blogging can be <a href="/2007/04/05/the-power-of-afrigation/">a more powerful tool for breaking news</a> than normal traditional media but I guess none of that's valid because it isn't filtered by sub-editors, editors and publishers?

In closing I might add that possibly there is justification in <strong>"looking at legislation to gag legitimate publications"</strong> as Bullard so poignantly put it?
