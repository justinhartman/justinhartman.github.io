The following pic was taken at <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> and features Ory Okolloh from <a href="http://kenyanpundit.com">kenyanpundit.com</a> talking about the cool things happening in Africa. 

Hopefully Ory will be kind enough to send me her keynotes so I can see exactly what this awesome screen-shot was all about!
