  content: Hi Justin, we have a relationship with iBurst that is mutually reciprocal.
    They have some branding on our site as we have on their site. They felt that MyDL
    had something to offer their community. We've had a number of iBurst clients join
    MyDL and they're enjoying it. I hope this answers your query?

  content: Louis-Marc, thanks for clearing this one up for me. I must say it's a great
    place to have an ad as people check their bandwidth often so well done on this!
