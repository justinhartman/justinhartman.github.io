A special thanks must go out to <a href="http://www.mikestopforth.com/">Mike Stopforth</a> and <a href="http://www.daveduarte.co.za/">Dave Duarte</a> for helping me to find a new job. Mike and Dave introduced me to Johan Reyneke of Ja! Productions and after a lengthy process I received an offer of employment from Johan this morning.

I'm very excited about this position as I believe I will really be able to shine in my new job opportunity. Johan and his team now know the best and worst of me and I really believe this has set up a great foundation for us to work well together. As I mentioned to them yesterday I honestly feel like they really get who I am and it's for this reason that I really wanted this job.

So, what will I do? Well I'm going to be managing some very exciting web-based projects and I will have the freedom to do what I know how to do best. I will also be working with Mike and Dave on various items which is very exciting for me as I have come to respect these two gentlemen very much. 

All in all it's been a good day and I'm looking forward to February 1st.
