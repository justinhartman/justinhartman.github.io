  content: Hey Justin. I installed add-on and it's cool and all but I doubt I'll ever
    use it - the bookmark tool seems far more easier. A suggestion would be to change
    the functionality where when the toolbar icon is clicked it converts the current
    long url to a TimesURL in the address bar, without any popups, explanations or
    whatever. Not too sure how possible that is, but it would flippen sweet if it
    was.

  content: "Hey Wezz. Thanks for the feedback. I fully agree with your point about
    the functionality but I can tell you this is only the beginning. There will be
    more to TimesURL which will be integrated into the Toolbar so watch this space
    for the update when it happens.\r\n\r\nIn terms of doing the shortening in the
    address bar I don't see how this will be possible. FireFox doesn't allow you to
    take control of the browser in this way but there might be other options to look
    into here."

  content: I haven't looked at the FireFox API but yeah I doubt if it's possible to
    control the address bar in that way. Although, have a look at twitterbar. The
    add-on uses the address bar pretty extensively.

The <a href="http://timesurl.at/plugins/firefox/">TimesURL FireFox Extension</a> is my first official attempt at a FireFox Plugin and I've had great fun in the process, along with some nasty headaches as well.
The add-on allows you to shorten and share a website directly from your browser. Simply click the TimesURL icon and the add-on will automatically shorten the URL for you and present you with the short version that you can share with your friends via email, post to <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> or bookmark on <a href="http://muti.co.za">Muti</a>.
This extension has been tested to work on <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/">FireFox 2.0.0.13</a> as well as the latest <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">Beta version 3.0b4</a>. It's really <a href="http://timesurl.at/plugins/firefox/">simple to install</a> and it's a great addition for those of you that use <a href="http://twitter.com/justinhartman">Twitter</a> or just want to share links with other people. 
We're working really hard at turning <a href="http://timesurl.at">TimesURL</a> (pronounced <em>times-earl</em>) into a destination to share information rather than just to shorten links and there is a lot under development to create this enhanced sharing experience.
If you haven't used TimesURL before then what better time to start using the service with an easy to use FireFox add-on?
