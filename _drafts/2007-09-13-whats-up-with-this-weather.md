Looking at my <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">Dashboard Widget</a> at around 00:00 I noticed that today's high was 32 degrees and that the current temperature is 23 degrees. Now forgive me if I am wrong but isn't this still supposed to be Spring in Johannesburg? This is not the first time either that we've hit well above the 30 degree mark and I have to say I'm dreading December if this is a prelude of things to come.
Makes you wonder if maybe we shouldn't start taking a serious look at what we're doing to our climate through the effects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">global warming</a>.
