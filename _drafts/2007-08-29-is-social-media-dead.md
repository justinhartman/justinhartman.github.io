  content: "I think William Gibson (http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/index.asp) probably
    has a broader perspective on this one. \r\n\r\nIn a conversation over at RadioOpensource.org
    he makes a comment about the 'disappearance of the virtual'. He explains how in
    the past we had little cyberspace and more of the real world and, how all of that
    has changed to the level where everything happens on the net. The strangness and
    newness of the net is slowly dissapearing and soon speaking in terms of the NET
    and Real world would become meaningless.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, I see the disappearance
    of Social Networks not so much so the disappearance but merely a slow assimilation
    and migration to something much bigger. \r\n\r\nI have mental images of this magnificent
    CGI rendering of a scene where you are viewing molecules moving round and round
    and as you zoom out you begin to see hundreds upon thousands of them as they get
    smaller and smaller, soon you are at magnify level where you realise you are looking
    at a primitive single cell organism like the amoeba and as you continue reducing
    the magnification level that single cell view zooms out and you see other cells
    and soon you realise you are looking at what appears to be neurons connected to
    each other and forming a pathway, no, a network of pathways. \r\n\r\nIn a similar
    way I think this is what is happening on the web."

  content: "Quincy I think I agree with you as well. The argument for me is not if
    Social Media is dead but rather what will it become and I think that would a good
    argument.\r\n\r\nIt's part of what Scoble was on about and I think he has a point.
    The idea that all these social networks will ultimately lead into the greater
    flow of data and profiling is the most interesting for me. This will propagate
    itself into search, advertising and marketing and through communication and it's
    happening as we speak(write)."

In today's Blogumist column in <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> <a href="http://www.chilibean.co.za/">Paul Jacobson</a> has written a piece titled <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/blogumists/2007/08/29/social-media-is-dead/">Social Media is dead</a>. Paul is a friend and a colleague but I have to say this article spurred some very negative reactions in me and I just think that this article is so far from the truth it's scary.
Paul argues that 
<blockquote>"Although Social Media is only just picking up steam here in South Africa, if you read the feeds on blogs and news sites in the United States and Europe it is fairly obvious that the whole thing is running out of steam."
</blockquote>
Now I'm not sure what news sites Paul is subscribed to but the ones I read tell the exact opposite but don't take my word on it, let the evidence talk.
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a>, A-List blogger and Vice President of Media Development at <a href="http://podtech.net">PodTech.net</a>, <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/08/26/why-mahalo-techmeme-and-facebook-are-going-to-kick-googles-butt-in-four-years/">recently argued</a> that social media sites <a href="http://mahalo.com/">Mahalo</a>, <a href="http://techmeme.com/">TechMeme</a>, and <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> are going to kick <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>&acirc;&euro;&trade;s butt in four years.
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/about-michael-arrington/">Michael Arrington</a>, another A-Lister and owner of the popular <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch</a> blog, also linked to Scoble's article and points out that 
<blockquote>Scoble argues that the search results from sites such as Mahalo will appeal to more people due to their ability to be socially constructed as opposed to Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s computer generated results.
</blockquote>
While Arrington doesn't necessarily agree with Scoble he's also not disagreeing with Scoble's thinking.
I'm pretty sure that while these are some good examples that Social Media is here to stay many will say that this only relates to the ever changing face of search and doesn't really equate to any level of social networking or social media.
Silicon Valley start-up investor <a href="http://www.edventure.com/">Esther Dyson</a> appeared on the <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/guests/esther-dyson">Charlie Rose</a> show where she discussed her current projects in the technology space. During this interview she was asked if Facebook is the new Google and to that Dyson replied
<blockquote>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;[It is] if you think Google is the next Microsoft.&acirc;&euro; So, is Google the new Microsoft? Dyson said, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;It could well be.&acirc;&euro;
</blockquote>
From my perspective I have to say that Social Media is changing the way we communicate on a global level. Search is becoming more relevant because of social media and will continue to do so for many years and social media sites are giving us a platform to communicate, share and evolve. 
Paul goes on to claim that
<blockquote>All the new launches are reinventions of Social Media companies that have been around for years now or are simply new applications of existing tools. There is no real innovation in this space. Social Media has climaxed. It is all downhill from here.
</blockquote>
Facebook's recent <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/20/facebook-opens-email-up-a-little-i-want-more/">emailing capabilities</a> allow users to now replace traditional email communication and their <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/23/facebook-integrates-book-swap-feature-into-marketplace/">Book Swap</a> feature highlights how social media can relate to real-world practical uses so I'm just not sure about this statement either.
Is Social Media dead? I think not.
