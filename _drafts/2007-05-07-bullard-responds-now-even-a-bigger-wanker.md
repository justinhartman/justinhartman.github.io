    even a casual reader of Bullard's column, you would know that some of his opinions
    need to be taken with a pinch of salt. That's why IT'S a column and NOT a hard
    news story because columns DON'T need to be fact; they are very subjective, kinda
    like a blog.\r\n\r\nInstead of complaining about the way we reacted, you should
    mention the fact that we actually responded at all. How many other print editors
    or journalists would've posted a response on their own blogs within the same day?
    \r\n\r\nThe other thing that particularly irks me, is the way certain \"bloggers\"
    have implied that either myself, Ray, Carly or Gregor could've done something
    about the column since we work within the organisation and play in the same digital
    space. While I don't necessarily agree with what was said in his column that is
    the beauty of a free and democratic press and no one can silence our journalists,
    especially David Bullard. Sorry to disappoint, but we are also not a PR agency
    so don't expect a humble apology or a sugarcoated explanation for why he said
    the things he said. It prompted debate and served its purpose... in the words
    of our good Police Commissioner - finish and kla.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I think
    this says a lot about the Sunday Times as a brand and it's one of the reasons
    so many people continue to read the paper religiously (hence the exaggerated huff
    'n puff).\r\n\r\nI look forward to discussing this with you over coffee or a cold
    beer when we finally meet in person and I hope you get well soon!"

    <strong>David Bullard responds &#8230;...</strong>
    &#8230; and the message is pretty clear really.

    We all did exactly what Bullard was aiming for.  We, the bloggers, focussed so heavily on Bullard's clearly inflammatory column so much that we drove a lot of traffic to it.  All we did was feed...

So <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=455225">Bullard has responded</a> via video all thanks to <a href="http://www.groogle.co.za/">Groogle</a> and while bloggers all over South Africa may have asked for an apology from the Sunday Times all we got was more of the same shit.
Now I'm sick with flu at the moment so my sense of humour is probably not what it should be but it would appear that Bullard's article is simply a moronic tactic to get reaction out of the blogosphere and to build up publicity for the Sunday Times. youngBLOOD has said as much <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/?p=186">in his blog post</a> this morning and I'm even more perplexed than before as everyone who was complaining last night seem to be all smiles today.
I know I'm no highly-paid, well-respected journalist for a major sunday newspaper but can someone humour me please?
A interesting point I got out of Bullard's response was that <em>he's a columnist that has never based any of his commentary on fact and that's was has made him last for 13 years</em>. He goes on to say that had he based his article on fact then he'd simply be a journalist however that's what makes him a columnist.
So, the question has to be asked Mr. Bullard - are you then just in fact a glorified blogger? It seems as if The Times' new Editor in his <a href="http://wildfrontier.wordpress.com/2007/05/07/huh-am-i-missing-something/">blog post</a> this morning might concur with me? 
It would appear by your statements that your column simply does not go through the "journalistic" procedures of being proof-read, checked for facts and approved by the editor so I'm struggling to see the difference between you and I? Oh wait, it's that huge salary you get paid.
Bullard goes on to say that as a journalist <em>he has responsibilities unlike "us" bloggers</em> when writing which makes me see red. How can he claim to have responsibilities when he can go on a scathing attack like he has against 70-million people world-wide and create a vastly negative impression to his huge Sunday Times readership?
If this is Sunday Times' reaction then I'm appalled. 
UPDATE: <a href="http://exhaustnotes.co.za/2007/05/07/hey-bullard/">This is just for some great fun</a>! I think I'll take this stance from here on in.
