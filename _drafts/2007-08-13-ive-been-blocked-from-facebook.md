    more specifically someone managing the server hates you or thinks you shouldn't
    waste so much time on facebook :-)

I'm the only one in <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> office but for some strange reason I've been blocked from <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. Wonder if they know something about me that I don't?
