  content: "Too many contractors act like this and it's pathetic. At House of Kolor
    we used to import tins of paint which would always arrive damaged by UTI. The
    most frustrating thing is they would always pass the buck on to the shipping company
    DHL who would do the same on to the carrier FedEX overseas, and so on...\r\n\r\nEvidence
    is a bitch!"

This morning <a href="http://stii.co.za">Stii</a> and I grabbed a cup of coffee from Ecco il Caffe in the BMW dealership below our offices. Over a healthy dose of java and nicotine we noticed a <a href="http://www.schenker.co.za/">Schenker Logistics</a> truck mishandling a load of fragile boxes.
The short video below shows one such box in particular but I'm just sorry I didn't manage to get video of the big box they moved only moments before. The previous box was the size of a 40" plasma TV and instead of lifting it off the ground the guy (pictured in the video below) simply rolled it from side-to-side - ignoring all the fragile signs!
So if you ever wondered what <strong>really</strong> happens to your fragile boxes then watch the clip below! I loved seeing this.
