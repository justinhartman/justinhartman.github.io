    a REAL threat to press freedom, no one will pay any attention.

  content: Steve I think part of the problem here is that I don't think the powers
    that be expected such a resounding response on this issue. To me it seems like
    they've backed down very cowardly to what were very serious allegations and threats.

On Sunday the <a href="http://tinylink.co.za/09aa5c">news broke</a> that Sunday Times editor, Mondli Makhanya and deputy managing editor Jocelyn Maker will be arrested some time this week. This is obviously a huge story for <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> and after a brief strategy session this morning we decided we'd try and use Social Media to track this major event in Media history.
After lots of coffee and the abuse of Nino's Internet connection we've managed to track all that's been written about this in the social media sphere. We've setup a dedicated <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/mondli">channel on Jaiku</a> which tracks posts from <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>, <a href="http://amatomu.com">Amatomu</a>, <a href="http://muti.co.za">Muti</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.
If you're a blogger and you write about this issue all you need to do is tag your posts with <strong><em>mondli</em></strong> and it will automatically appear in the <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/mondli">Jaiku channel</a>. If you're not a blogger but want to comment on this issue you can also do so by visiting the channel and having your say.
We've also got a cool widget for your blog or news site that shows the latest from the Jaiku channel and you can grab the code below.
<code>&#60;object width="200" height="330"&#62;
