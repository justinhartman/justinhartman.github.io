  content: Nice work Justin. Your inner design flair has surfaced! One small thing
    I would change is the red to white gradient in the top bar around the rss buttons.
    Think it would look better as a flat colour, or perhaps the current red blending
    into a darker red.

  content: Nice layout, but I thought your previous one was awesome :) I tried finding
    out where I could get it to play around with, but I'm guessing it was made by
    a South Korean? The only places I could find on the net that seemed to be using
    the same general layout were in Korean, which of course I can't read, haha.

In a sad and shallow attempt for exposure <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Groogle</a> and I have decided to launch our new blog designs at the same time. That aside, I have needed a new, fresh look for some time now and I'm very happy with the final results. 
Not only has the design changed but I've redone my <a href="/profile/">Profile</a>, <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> and <a href="/contact.html">Contact</a> page and brought them more up to date with what's going on in my life. I've also taken on a new Blogroll strategy and I've decided to only link to people that I regularly interact with so I'm hoping to meet more people over the coming months and increasing my <em>real-life</em> blogroll.
