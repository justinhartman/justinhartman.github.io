I only officially start at <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> on August 1st but I've already got my first responsibility. This screenshot was taken off <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> a short while ago.
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/07/thetimes.png' alt='The Times on Facebook' />
I'm not yet sure what a <em>Group Contributor</em> should be doing for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2393022979&ref=mf">The Times' Facebook Group</a> so I'd better check in with the <a href="http://groogle.co.za/">multimedia</a> <a href="http://rantofnote.blogspot.com/">team</a> and find out what the job entails.
I'm guessing it would have something to do with recruiting new Facebook users to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2393022979&ref=mf">Group</a> as well as working on content but more will be revealed as and when I know ;)
