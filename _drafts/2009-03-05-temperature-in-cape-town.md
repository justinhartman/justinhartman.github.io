    must be dying in the CBD.\r\n\r\nI was out in my car just now and everyone was
    driving with their lights on 'cos the smoke is so thick!\r\n\r\nIt's *really*
    odd not being able to see the mountain, sheesh ... quite disorientating actually
    - us Capies can't navigate without the MOWNTAIN heh :-)"

    yeah I know what you mean. I'm in Claremont now so I'm feeling much better here
    but I've been watching the temperature from Century City to CBD and it's been
    consistent at between 38-40 degrees.\r\n\r\n@joyanne heat is one thing but this
    is INSANE !!!\r\n\r\n@Jason, thinking about putting on my jersey now...\r\n\r\n@Robin

  content: With the -8 degrees we've had for the past couple of days here in New York
    and the snow on the ground now frozen in dirty, icy piles, I could do with a couple
    of hours of 40+ celsius... Perhaps we just need to balance it out - that would
    be perfection!

  content: It's been pretty hot in George as well today, although I don't think it
    was _that_ hot. The only place I've experienced those temperatures is Gaborone
    but at least the humidity in Gabs is normally quite low, which helps a lot.

    arrive at the V&amp;A Waterfront on the morning of 31st March and was just Googling
    to find out what the weather  is like.  I'm glad I did.  We are only there for
    5 days but it's good to be prepared.  of course it might cool down by then.  So
    looking forward to being in the Cape again.\r\n\r\nWe are 'bunkering' (re-fuelling)
    in Singapore at the moment having just left Vietnam.  It must be about 90 degrees
    on our very still decks at the moment .  The students love it but we're enjoying
    the aircon!  next stop India so we shall be sweltering there too..."

  content: Does anyone know of a good guide around Cape Town for people on board who
    don't know the area.  I think a tour to Cape Point, including Kirstenbosch gardens,
    Table Mountain if it's clear, Chapman's Peak drive, Boulders etc etc  iust don't
    know who the best guides are...someone who would perhaps drive them? I would be
    grateful for any suggestions...thanks!

I know everyone in Cape Town is talking about the heat wave we're experiencing but I just had to share this with people who aren't here right now.
This is the time in Cape Town:
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/03/img_0051.jpg" alt="Time right now in Cape Town" />
And this was the temperature in the City:
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/03/img_0047.jpg" alt="Temperature in Cape Town at 15:55" />
Now I'm not a big fan of heat but I don't think I've ever been in a place where the temperature was more than 35 degrees. 40.5 degrees is something that is well and truly stifling. There has been a thick haze of smoke all over the city from all the fires and I haven't been able to see the sea or mountain since 9am.
Come to think of it, without the sea and mountain it kind of feels a lot like Jo'burg!
