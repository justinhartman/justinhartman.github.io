    say family time can never be recovered, but I can also relate to the tug-o-war
    between wanting to provide financially for your family and spending actual quality
    time with them. Never easy, and never black and white either.

    <strong>If I could do it all over again...</strong>
    Recently Derivco hosted the first GIBS Leadership Forum event in Durban. Keynote speaker was Brand Pretorius, chairman and chief executive of McCarthy Motor Holdings. At the end of his speech one of the things he was asked was how he......

  content: "Justin it takes a lot of guts to be open and honest like that, I applaud
    you. Balancing family and work is very tough these days - especially if you're
    an entrepreneur. We always seem to have the need to go that extra mile in order
    to make our ventures succeed. \r\n\r\nI've been trying to manage this with my
    wife as well. I've actually just returned from a non-business trip. Friday morning
    we hopped on a plane with 2 friends to Durban. Besides one report I had to do
    and email off, I did absolutely no work this weekend. We had loads of fun and
    it was well worth it. \r\n\r\nI've been trying to latch onto a lesson by Stephen
    Covey - about the emotional back account. He says that the more deposits you make,
    the more withdrawals you have available when you need them.\r\n\r\nThis weekend
    was a huge deposit. If I have to work late this week - for example - that's a
    withdrawal, but it'll be okay because I'll still have a smiling bank balance.\r\n\r\nI
    hope your marriage and business ventures are filled with all the goodness and
    splendor that you deserve!\r\n\r\nJamaal"

    things, but I get very irritated if it happens week after week.  You can ask Stii

    chat will be good with this in mind. Looking forward to seeing you again! There's
    a time to trust that all things work out for the greater good, but that also involves
    us doing some work inside ourselves too inbetween all that going on. Looks like
    you've been doing your homework, sir. Perhaps I can share one small thing I've
    learned while trying to do my homework - as productive as a person is when they're
    putting their 'all' into projects and work, its amazing how you can be more effective
    in those things [even putting in less time and effort] when the things that really
    matter in life are cast in stone in your heart. Stay strong!

    and I go through the same thing - finding time between plane trips, and late night
    presentation preparations, late night courses, frantically reading and preparing
    for early morning teaching slots. What has worked for us is to make sure that
    we MAKE time for one another. It is conscious but done with great heart from both
    sides and it seems to be working. And making time doesn't even need to be a weekend
    away. It can be half an hour of genuine presence with someone you love. People
    complain about not having enough time with the person they love - seldom because
    of the amount of time but because of the quality of that time. We have a saying
    called Shifty Eyes and that's our code when either of us is geting so busy that
    we are losing the idea of the other one being present. It works for us. Maybe
    it could also work for you. Take care, Elaine"

Friday evening was a particularly difficult evening for my marriage and I've been rethinking my existence ever since. Not to bore you with semantics but the overall gist is that because of my professional existence both at <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> and with my other various <a href="/projects/">projects</a> I am having no time to dedicate to my relationship with her.
I knew this was an issue and I could feel the impact it has had on her but I was going along with the idea that all this work was going to amount to something at some point and secure our future. While there has been good progress I have to ask at what price does this all come?
<a href="http://vincentmaher.com">Certain</a> <a href="http://ofrelevance.com/">other</a> <a href="http://www.buzzfuse.com/">people</a> will agree that Venture Capital in SA sucks and as a result every <del datetime="2007-11-05T07:53:10+00:00">bright</del> hair-brained scheme I've had has been implemented on <strong>zero</strong> budget with very little resources.
While I have had an awesome experience in the process and learnt a lot about my capabilities there is only so long one can go on for before <em>nothing</em> needs to amount to <em>something</em> and I guess this is where I am.
The time I've lost with my family can never be recovered and I simply can't hold on to the idea that at some point something will work - what if it doesn't?
I've done some soul searching and come to the conclusion that if it doesn't make me money it isn't worth my time and I will now focus solely on my job position at The Times and continue with <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> for a limited time to see if our new business model can actually work.
