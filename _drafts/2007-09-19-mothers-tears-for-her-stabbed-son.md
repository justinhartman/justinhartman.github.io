  content: I agree that it is sickening, but it scares the crap out of me more. Imagine
    that was your child? Can you IMAGINE what it must feel like? I don't think there
    is ANYTHING worse in life than losing a child. Pure, pure hell on earth. Shit
    like this makes one wonder what future your kids have. The future you try to give
    them can be taken away in a flash by some dumbasses who play God. It is really
    upsetting.
