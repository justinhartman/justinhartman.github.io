    in being in an industry and that being your day job(sorry the Internet does not
    have any hours..) and reading a book and then trying to draw conclusions based
    on it.\r\n\r\nI did not realize the effect of Internet business in South Africa
    until it became my occupation.I tend to believe that South Africa has more internet
    businesses that what the general public are aware of..\r\n\r\nAlso these books
    in general take America/ North America as its country of origin and not a developing
    country like South Africa's and the African continent.\r\n\r\nAlso do I have it
    wrong in that the Twitter guys were involved with Blogger which they sold to Google??"

    fact is that the way we interact and share is changing. Facebook and Twitter won't
    be the be all and end all of the story. Fact is we are at the beginning of a paradigmn
    shift to a real-time consciousness, a shared one. The need to share conscience

    is this article has been presented to an audience that is really confused about
    this new wave of interaction called social media.\r\n\r\nI understand journalism
    (come from a long line of journalists and worked in the industry myself) and it
    is irresponsible to write something like this when you clearly have no understanding
    of what it means. Had Monique been a seasoned social media expert and written
    this then there would have been valid, counter arguments to the statement that
    it's not worth it.\r\n\r\nHowever, as she clearly isn't, the article is based
    on ilogical statements that are aimed to just defy the validity of something that
    has clearly worked for many many people.\r\n\r\nSo no, we haven't over-reacted
    at all. I, like \"South African\", would hope that Monique and the team at Moneyweb
    would now counter this article with one that is based more on fact than speculation."

  content: "Dear Justin \r\n\r\nThank you for the time you spent commenting on my
    article, I really appreciate the feedback. Just thought it is worth mentioning
    that my article was written in response to a book I read by Juliette Powell called
    33 Million People in the Room and was clearly marked as a book review. The author
    gives the impression that it is easy to make money out of social media and become
    a micro-celebrity. I disagree with her. Not much thought seems to be given as
    to how one makes money out of social media. For example, I had a meeting with
    someone who develops social networks for businesses, when I asked him what the
    business case would be for Moneyweb developing its own one he said he had no idea.
    With regards to Blogger it was not making money when Google bought it.\r\nThe
    other issue I had with 33 Million People is that it seemed to suggest that if
    you use social media, Reed's theory would magically apply, which did not
    happen with Cope, and as you rightly pointed out, you need to do more than just
    have a presence on social media to make a success of your business or party. \r\nI
    do agree with you and your commentators that the story of how South Africans are
    making money from social media needs to be told. I would love to do a follow up
    article on how Afrigator, The Couch, Marc Ashwell, imod etc, are making money.
    I am certain that it was not as easy as Powell suggested in her book. Can I get
    in touch with you next week?  \r\nFinally, your assertion that I have no understanding
    of what social media means is incorrect. I created Moneyweb's Facebook page
    and run its twitter feed.  I also co-founded MoneywebTax, a niche tax website."

  content: "Hi Monique\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to respond to this - it is
    appreciated. Let me state off the bat that I'm ecstatic that you'll be doing
    a follow up to this. I welcome any effort to try and look at the benefits to social
    media and I commend you for this. Obviously I'd be more than willing to
    answer any questions you have so please get in touch when you get a chance.\r\n\r\nI
    think what you're trying to get to is the free model that hampers most Web
    2.0 startups. The concept, in short, is to get global adoption of a product by
    offering free services, etc. to consumers with little to no effort in trying to
    turn a valuable service into a serious business.\r\n\r\nI don't disagree
    with you n this, but I think it's important to note a startup's strategy
    from the get go. It's seems that most Web 2.0 startups are just trying to
    attain global penetration and as a result monetisation is of little importance.
    This doesn't mean however that it doesn't exist nor does it mean that
    social media sites aren't making serious money.\r\n\r\nLook at Flickr. A
    great photo sharing site with a solid business model in place. The &ldquo;freemium&rdquo;
    model comes to mind here. Always offer the core free but place greater emphasis
    on value-adds that encourage users to upgrade for a small price.\r\n\r\nThat all
    said I am looking forward to chatting about these issues in greater detail."

  content: "There's soooo many ways to make bucks from social media. I just popped
    this on the Moneyweb site:\r\n\r\nThere are very few people making a full income
    from selling advertising on their blogs. Some examples of this are: Backpackers.com,
    2oceansvibe.com, iMod.co.za and Tertia.org\r\n\r\nThere are, however, lots of
    bloggers making a little bit of money from advertising on their blogs (AdGator
    from Afrigator, and Google's AdSense are particularly useful in this regard).\r\n\r\nThat
    said, there a growing number of people, like myself, who monetize their blogs
    indirectly by using the blog to support other business. For example, my blog sends
    through a regular stream of delegates on my courses, and bookings for my talks.
    This makes blogging a lucrative activity for me, and I consider my blog a valuable
    asset."

    I am so disappointed in you. You've just shown us again that you are not prepared
    to conduct thorough research on your topics.\r\n\r\nHave you heard of Blogger
    Pro? The premium feature version of Blogger that brought the company back from
    the brink of death long before Google got interested?\r\n\r\nHere's a thought:
    Get yourself a copy of Founders At Work by Jessica Livingston. I've written a
    brief review about it here( <a href=\"http://tr.im/q3nO\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tr.im/q3nO</a>
    )\r\n\r\nThis book interviews tech startup founders (including Evan Williams)and
    discusses their experiences on the road to success. \r\n\r\nMore than anything,
    I think this book will help anyone put the word \"Social Media\" in context and
    give them a better understanding of how it came about that I'm responding to you
    in a comment, recommending a helpful book that I'm have no financial interest
    in, thus spreading the word about an author who deserves to get paid for publishing
    an excellent piece of work :-)"

    specifics but the point is that there is a vast difference between sharing (being
    a member of a group is acknowledging a common interest), cooperating, collaborating
    and collective action. Even stimulating individual action arising out of a shared
    belief can be a stretch but political campaigns like Obamas show us that, correctly
    understood and incubated ... social media can be a powerful and relevant tool.
    The trick, I think, is managing the \"tragedy of the commons\" effect ... the
    insidious and fatal sense that \"I don't need to take action ... my lack of effort
    will not damage the whole, someone else will do it\" phenomenon."

I had the unfortunate pleasure to read an article on Moneyweb titled <a href="http://moneyweb.co.za/mw/view/mw/en/page156233?oid=295958&sn=Detail"><em>Social Media: Is it worth it?</em></a> written by Monique Vanek. The ignorance of the article made me quite mad and I decided to send Monique and the Moneyweb Editor an email highlighting what I felt were the core issues in the article. 
Herewith my reponse. Let me know what you think about it.
<blockquote>Dear Monique
Someone sent me the link to an article you wrote on 8 June titled "Social media: Is it worth it?" (http://gatorurl.com/qmi3mg). Let me begin by saying that while I see your view-point regarding big social media sites such as Twitter & Facebook being unable to monetise their websites and become profitable I strongly disagree with most of the remaining article.
Let me disseminate some of your statements and highlight my perspective on the issues you raise.
<strong><em>But somehow I have difficulty accepting Powell's suggestions: how many microcelebrity's are there? Does it not come down more to the year you were born in, your culture, your history and being dealt the right hand at the right time, as Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers illustrates?</em></strong>
I too have read Gladwell's Outliers and agree with everything he wrote in the book. I am a strong believer in the principle's of the year you were born in, your culture, your history and more importantly the 10,000 hour rule but I struggle to see the relevance in the context of your article. If you look at Evan Williams, Mark Zuckerberg and Biz Stone you'll see that they all form part of the culture that defines Outliers and I'm pretty sure we'll find that each one of them have been granted extraordinary opportunities that have helped define their individual, personal success.
<em><strong>How much value can there be in a service that spews out so much information that if you have prolific tweeters and many follows on your profile you see hardly any of their entries?</strong></em>
Value is in the eye of the beholder but from my personal experience this prolific information has helped determine a new way to spread information that is both useful, relevant and real-time. There is no other platform in the world that really highlights how real-time interaction can change perceptions, influence brands and drive revenue than Twitter does. Even Google is now trying to look at how they can plug into the real-time data that is Twitter.
<strong><em>Social media firm Facebook is yet to make a profit. It failed to deliver on Reed's promise for Cope. Cope's Facebook group had over 20 000 members before the elections, but only managed to get 7% of the vote.</em></strong>
This statement is laughable and taken completely out of context and I find it quite sad that you'd even try to relate a Facebook groups membership directly to COPE's inability to obtain more than 7% of the vote. While COPE's Facebook group may have attracted 20,000 members you failed to contextualise that COPE entered the political sphere with a bang and created a new sense of hope for voters in South Africa who were fed up with the ANC's inability to deliver on their promises. However, by the time election day came round COPE's decisions and actions started to highlight their flaws in their initial strategy. While 20,000 members may have supported them on a Facebook group what isn't clear is just how many lost confidence as and when COPE started to lose support.
By contrast, the DA's social media strategy was very aggressive and molded off the Obama election campaign and they had a very successful voting day which won them the Western Cape. The DA group on Facebook only has 25,000 members and Reed's promise may have delivered for them because their message never changed along the way. It just interests me how you chose to highlight how Reed's promise and Facebook failed to deliver for COPE but at the same time ignored the effect this may (or may not) have had on the DA.
<strong><em>I am yet to meet or hear of a South African who has used social media to make money, influence people or change their career. If you know of any Saffers who have, share your story below...</em></strong>
Your lack of understanding and knowledge in social media is clear to me when you make such a sweeping statement to an audience (Moneyweb readers) that is struggling to come to terms with how social media can benefit them. I run a very successful company that has been built entirely on the ability to use social media to help grow our business. We use no traditional mediums to market and grow our company yet despite this we managed to take a garage startup to part-acquisition when MIH Print Africa, a division of Naspers, bought into our company.
Then let's look at how Storm Hoek wines (www.stormhoek.co.za) used only social media to market and promote their brand. They targeted bloggers and social media platforms to promote their wines and had massive success along the way. They export wine all over the world.
The list goes on and I can write a book on the amount of people, in South Africa, that have used social media to grow businesses, influence other people and change their career path. I myself used my blog to get a new job which would ultimately set me on a course to start Afrigator.
I would, in all honesty, re-consider your initial approach of this article and look to write a more detailed one that includes some basic research and perhaps trying to explore how South African's are using the medium successfully. Your readers deserve as much.
