    my blog. \r\n\r\nI am so pleased Adgator has come on the scene as I have been
    saying for a loooooong time we need a local model for SA.  All the revenue I earn
    is from international ad programs like BlogHer, BlogAds etc.  I make fairly good
    money out of it.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing some Adgator ads come through
    on my blog soon!"

    R3,000 or not :)\r\n\r\nAnyway, 8th Dec is launch date of the first advertiser
    with a few more in the pipeline. \r\n\r\nIt's been a bit slow kicking it off and
    we'd hoped it would have happened a lot sooner but things will pick up pace quite
    nicely in the new year I think!!!"

    is completely inaccurate. More and more people are voicing that they completed
    the question and have indicated an earning higher than R3000.\r\n\r\nAmanda Reekie
    from imagineNATION Alliance (who compiled the stats) has said that they omitted
    the 2.9% of bloggers who earned more than R3000. After reading the comments I
    have to say it looks like it was omitted for sensationalist reasons.\r\n\r\nIt
    sounds so much better to say NO ONE makes money from blogging than to say well
    actually... 2.9% make in excess of R3,000 a month and in fact they will continue
    to earn big.\r\n\r\nAnd to add I'd also like to ask (as per Coda's comment) how
    did they get to 88.4% from a total of 610 users in a pool of 1000+ respondents?\r\n\r\nIt
    looks like this one slide is going to ruin the entire survey which is sad."

    now we know that there can't be more than 856 respondents but what this slide
    doesn't take into account is that people could have selected multiple blogging
    platforms thereby making the respondent amount less than 856.\r\n\r\nEither way
    if you take 856 as the respondent field then 610 users would actually equate to
    71.26% of bloggers earn no money.\r\n\r\nHowever, if 610 is actually 88.4% of
    the total pool then it means the total respondent number is in fact 690 and not
    1000.\r\n\r\nI will check with Alistair on this."

<a href="http://blogs.24.com/ViewBlog.aspx?blogid=a7ec9c92-5631-47fa-ab07-412a7b68bacf">Alistair</a>, the brains behind the SA Blog Survey, sent me a very interesting slide yesterday about the revenue that bloggers earn from their blogs. As most of you will know <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> was proud to be associated with the 24.com SA Blog survey and according to Alistair there were over 1,000 responses to the survey.
I think this is a pretty good response rate, all things considered, but for me the interesting bit was seeing that 88.4% of SA bloggers earn <em>zero</em> revenue from their blogs while the additional 11.6% earn no more than R3,000 a month.
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/11/blog-survey.png" alt="" />
As you can see, of the people who do earn money, the average a blogger makes is between R1 and R200 a month. 24.com have said that <em>"blogging for the most part is not about making money"</em> but I have to wonder if this isn't because there hasn't really been a viable method to earn revenue from blogs.
I have believed for a long time that bloggers don't make money from their blogs not out of choice but simply because there hasn't been a model that is tailored to them. I speak from experience since I've tried Google Adsense, Affiliate Marketing and various other forms of revenue generation and to be honest getting a cheque from Google once every six months for R750 just doesn't cut it for me.
Most blogs don't generate that much traffic so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_per_click">PPC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_action">CPA</a> are models that simply don't work. These are great revenue streams if you're generating 1 million plus impressions but if you're only doing 5,000 it becomes a lot more difficult to make any real money.
I think this slide further validates my position on launching <a href="http://adgator.co.za">Adgator</a> into the SA market. As with Afrigator, everything we've done has been based on our own personal experiences and Adgator is no different. There is a lot of money being thrown around in online advertising and I think it's time bloggers shared in the revenue.
Don't get me wrong - I don't like advertising that much and the thought of bombarding my limited readership with dodgy ads is not something I take lightly however I do feel that if the value proposition is right then I'd be happy to dedicated a spot on my site. If I can truly see earning potential then I'd take the plunge because R750 a month is a lot better than R750 every six.
Adgator has been doing phenomenally well since <a href="/2008/11/11/adgator-africas-first-blog-advertising-network/">we launched it some two weeks ago</a> and the good news for bloggers and advertisers is that we've just finished building the backend interfaces. This means bloggers and advertisers who've shown an interest and/or signed up will be getting login details to monitor their earnings and track campaigns.
Adgator has been an unbelievable learning experience. While we may have honestly believed we were ready for a launch I know now that there was no way we could have prepared ourselves for the massive uptake of the program. That said, the technology is now complete, we have most of the data we need and we have an exciting advertiser coming on board from 8 December. Money will start to filter through to the bloggers who've signed up and the earning potential is going to increase considerably in the new year.
I know that guys have itchy feet but in the coming months the average money earned by a blogger through Adgator is going to be a lot higher than R200! I can't wait to see the blog survey stats this time next year...
