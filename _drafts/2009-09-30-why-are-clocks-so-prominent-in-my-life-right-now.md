  content: I'd suggest reading "Fooled by Randomness" and about cognitive biases in
    general.  Cognitive biases (such as clustering illusion, where you see a pattern
    in actually random events) are hard to overcome, even when you know about them.

  content: "Wow. Justin. This story resonated with me so much. So so much. Life does
    this to us. It kinda gives us a message without saying anything and then says
    \"DO IT NOW are you listening?\"\r\n\r\nMy simple answer is \"time\". Maybe we
    all need more of it. \r\n\r\nxxxx\r\nCath"

  content: Neil, I think I like the naivet&eacute; of feeling like there's a meaning
    behind these things. It somehow makes me feel like there is a deeper meaning to
    life.

  content: "Tick tock, tick tock...  :)\r\n\r\nCan't resist adding this one - one
    of my favourite paintings is \"The Persistence of Memory\" by Salvador Dali <a
    href=\"http://arthistory.about.com/od/from_exhibitions/ig/dali_painting_and_film/dali_moma_0708_11.htm\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">which you can see here</a>\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I think Margot might
    be on to something with her comment above. Could also just be a fascination stemming
    from talk about clocks at school or a friend who got a watch - these things affect
    the little guys more than we realise."

  content: "I'm a bit disappointed in you buddy. I would expect you to approach this
    with logic and reason, not this hippy crap ;-)\r\n\r\nI rate the fact that the
    clock illustration is Lukes favorite, should explain it.\r\n\r\nLuke most probably
    likes the clock page as there aren't any clocks in your house (Kids want what
    they can't have) and in general, clocks and watches are seen as cool grown up
    items. As a result he tells the shrink that's what he wants most (Like you would
    want to buy a car after seeing it in a magazine). \r\n\r\nIf it where not Luke
    wanting a clock as a result of the book illustration, you would never have thought
    twice about the phone call.\r\n\r\nIf you stuck on what to do and want to find
    some hippy meaning in it all, try this - Buy a cool clock for Luke from your friends
    mother (GatorClock preferably)? It'll make Luke happy and you will be supporting
    your friends mother?\r\n\r\nLastly, be happy Luke is dreaming of clocks and not
    quad bikes ;-)"

  content: Classic! Since I read this article, I started placing clocks further away
    from myself, so I wasn't so driven the whole time and it made a good difference

<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/09/1701081_KidAlarmClocks_06SW-150x150.jpg" alt="Kids Clocks" title="Kids Clocks" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-845" />I'm struggling to find the meaning behind this but for some reason <strong>children's clocks</strong> are featuring very prominently in my life right now.
Two days ago Colette and I went to see a psychologist about our eldest son Luke. There's nothing wrong with him but we were asked by the pre-school to put him through a series of tests to see if he is ready for big school (i.e. Grade 1) next year. The meeting was essentially a report-back on her findings.
While the results of the tests were very interesting (more about this in a later post) the strangest thing emerged. One of the questions asked to him was if he had three wishes what would he wish for. His first answer was... a clock. Colette and I were both taken aback as was the psychologist. None of us could figure out why a five year old would wish for a clock.
During the session we also realised that we don't have a single clock in our house. Not only that but neither of us own watches either so there is nothing apart from computers and mobile phones indicating the time. Maybe this is the only meaning around this but then some more random events happened.
Last night I received a phone call from my late best friend's mother. We haven't spoken in over two years and I think it's mostly due to the fact that the context of our relationship was connected through my friend and with him not being there it was difficult to maintain the relationship when we both reminded each other of him. So, needless to say it was a pleasant and unexpected surprise to hear her voice again.
I suspected that the call was in relation to the sixth anniversary of his death (September 15th) but this wasn't the case at all. She contacted me to tell me that she'd started making, wait for it..., children's clocks in her spare time and wanted to know if I can help her market the kids clocks online.
Soon after the phone call I put Luke to bed. Every night Colette reads him a story before bedtime but last night I decided that I should do story-time instead. As is customary Luke choses a book and tonight was a rather large Dr. Seuss collection of five stories.
Luke opened up the book and said to me that he wants to show me his best part. He continued to page through to a particular page in the book and said <em>look Dad, this is it</em>. I took the book from him and asked him why this page was his best and he said, <em>because the long hand is hanging off looking all squiggly</em> and he was referring to the rather comical looking clock on the page.
Maybe I'm being nuts but these three, seemingly random events around clocks, kids clocks in particular have me wondering if there's not something there. I don't believe in co-incidence, I believe in things happening for a reason and everything has meaning but I can't find anything online that can help me understand this better.
Hopefully you have more insight into the random events of the last two days.
