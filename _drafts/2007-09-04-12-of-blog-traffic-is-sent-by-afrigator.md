If any of you have been watching the <a href="http://www.afrigator.com/trends">Afrigator Trends</a> page you will have noticed that yesterday we sent a whopping <strong>19,951</strong> clicks through to blog sites who have <a href="http://www.afrigator.com/login/join">joined up</a> at <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>. This is an increase of 6,250 clicks from our previous best during the last 15 days which was 13,701 on <a href="http://www.afrigator.com/date/2007-08-21">21 August 2007</a>.
We've hit the 20,000 mark before on Afrigator but this is the first time we've sent such big traffic to blog sites since <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2007/08/29/new-blog-trends-and-twitter-channel/">the launch</a> of the Afrigator Trends page. This got me thinking about the stats we track and I decided to play around and these are the results.

The table above uses data over a nine day period and shows all the metrics we have for total page views and clicks sent to blog sites. You can see from this table that we sent <strong>104,536</strong> clicks to blog sites and we tracked a total of <strong>851,598</strong> page views*.
From this I worked out the percentage of traffic we're sending to blog sites in relation to the page views being recorded and this ratio shows that members of Afrigator get <strong>12.28%</strong>* of their total page view traffic from us.
From the averages row I worked out the frequency at which we're sending traffic to blog sites and below are some pretty cool, but utterly useless results.
<ul>
<li>We send an average of <strong>11,615</strong> clicks to blog sites daily.</li>
<li><strong>483.96</strong> clicks are sent every hour.</li>
<li><strong>8.07</strong> clicks are sent every minute.</li>
</ul>
This effectively means that we're sending a new user to a blog site every <strong>7.44 seconds</strong>.
<em>* Disclaimer: It is important to note that not every blog site signed up with Afrigator adds the tracking code to their website. This means that our Page View and Traffic Average figures are only as accurate as the sites we collect this data for. The Page View and Traffic Average figures would be vastly affected if all the blog sites used the Afrigator tracking code.
The total and average click through statistics remain unaffected and accurate despite this.</em>
