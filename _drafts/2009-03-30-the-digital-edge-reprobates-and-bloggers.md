<img align="right" src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/03/picture-11.png" alt="The Digtial Edge" />I've long been a fan of the new <a href="http://www.thedigitaledge.co.za/">Digital Edge</a> podcast series produced by Jarred Cinman and Saul Kropman. When it launched some 12 episodes ago Cambrient received a bit of flack for the <em>promotion</em> of their company but I think over time the content of The Digital Edge has won the battle over the perceived, professional marketing carried within.
What I really like about the podcast series is that it's short (generally around 15-20 minutes), the content is relevant to the industry and the production quality is superb. In a time when information overload is a major concern this podcast series gives you bite-sized bits of information on the go.
To my embarrassment I've been meaning to blog about The Digital Edge for some time but as you can see from the lack of posts on my blog lately time has simply not been on my side. Today however I do have a reason as I'm featured in the latest podcast titled <a href="http://www.thedigitaledge.co.za/cambrient2/view/cambrient2/en/page213?oid=356&sn=Detail">Reprobates and bloggers</a>.
The latest installment looks at the state of the South African blogosphere to see what was really happening. It features top SA bloggers as well as <a href="http://www.worldwidecreative.co.za/">Fred Roed</a> and <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>'s other brother, <a href="http://www.mikestopforth.com">Mike Stopforth</a>. This episode is quite long but I really won't mind if you skip to the end to listen to me! ;)
