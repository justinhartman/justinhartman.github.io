    but if we don;t act quickly we will be. We need to reorient our democracy from
    the top down model and build it from the bottom up, so that government is more
    accountable and more responsive. Pie in the sky? Maybe, but there isn;t an alternative.

I've just watched a disturbing Photo Story on the Times Multimedia titled <a href="http://multimedia.thetimes.co.za/photos/2008/05/flames-of-hate/">Flames of Hate</a>. As violence in Gauteng spreads so does the nature of beast and now these savages have resorted to burning people alive.
<a href="http://multimedia.thetimes.co.za/photos/2008/05/flames-of-hate/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2378/2502675693_dac099262b.jpg" alt="Flames of Hate" /></a>
I remarked earlier in the week that these xenophobic-related attacks reminded me of the township violence in the 80's and after seeing this photo story there is no doubt in my mind that we have a civil war on our hands.
One of the most moving books I've ever read was about four South African photographers, Kevin Carter, Greg Marinovich, Ken Oosterbroek and Joao Silva called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang-Bang_Club">Bang-Bang Club</a>. 
Their story documents their experiences within the townships of South Africa during the Apartheid era and their photographs illustrate the murderous struggle between ANC and Inkatha Freedom Party in what was the hostel wars.
Not only did it paint a gruesome picture into what photographers and journalists had to go through during this troubled time but it gave me a very harrowing and disturbing insight into the township violence that was taking place while I was playing blissfully in suburbia. 
For the first time in my life really, I became aware of how brutal and savage we as a nation are and I hoped we'd never have to see the same thing happening ever again. 
Cue 1994, democratic society and finally this country is given hope. Under Mandela we live the dream and never before has the world seen a country transform as quickly as it did in all aspects of life. Or did it?...
What has become clear in my mind the last two years is just how oppressed our nation feels. We lived in this cloud of euphoria during the Mandela years but under Thabo Mbeki's reign we've seen very real issues come to the fore which are less than pretty.
Two core issues come to mind. First is that South Africa has the highest HIV/Aids infection rate in the world and second is that South Africa has one of the worst (if not the worst) murder rate. These two issues have existed even during the honeymoon period but it's taken us 14-odd years to finally realise that we have some serious underlying issues that not even Mandela himself can resolve.
Cue Zimbabwe and South Africa's lack of addressing the dictator called Mugabe and we're now faced with 4-million exiled Zimbabweans living in South Africa fighting for their livelihood.
The events of the Xenophobic attacks the last week or so are a culmination of years of suppressed anger and frustration towards Government's lack of providing and delivery of promises made. For 14-odd years the <em>poor</em> have been told that they would now finally be able to survive and provide for their families yet somehow this hasn't changed much for them. Couple this with Government's stance on Zimbabwe and you wonder why people have had enough?
While I can clearly see the issues I have to say none of this warrants the hatred and blood-shed we've seen take place since 1994 and in greater intensity over the last 7 days. 
Last week my domestic worker fell victim to these attackers as she and her two daughters, all South African, were kicked out of their house, electricity cut and left in the streets until 2am in the morning. She said that two blocks up from her two people had allegedly been killed for being suspected foreigners living in the area. She also made it very clear that the attackers don't care what nationality you are, all they care about is creating anarchy.
It is clear that what has started as an attack on foreigners is now just an attack on our freedom because these savages just want to inflict pain and fear into the hearts of all the residents of this country.
I have a very real problem with victims standing up for their rights and in turn becoming the oppressor, all the while doing as much damage as your oppressor has inflicted on you. What good is it setting a man on fire, raping women, or beating someone within an inch of his/her life? Does this actually solve anything, are you really addressing the problem?
I'm about fed up with the state of this nation as are a lot of other people. White, Black, Indian, Coloured, whatever - we all want to see a change and feel safe and secure in our country.
I've also had enough of this disrespect for the value of life. Senseless killing is an everyday occurrence in this country and it has to stop. As a parent I am responsible for safe-guarding my wife and two children yet how is this possible when a large chunk of our nation lacks the basic moral fibre for life?
To the ANC, Mr. Mbeki and Mr. Zuma, what are you, as leaders of this country, going to do to save this country from the turmoil we are faced with? I'm feeling hopeless at the moment and I want to feel hope once again...
