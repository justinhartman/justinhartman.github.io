<img align="right" src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/04/picture-44-150x150.png" alt="Presentation at Nomadic Marketing" title="Presentation at Nomadic Marketing" width="150" height="150" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-627" />On Tuesday I was invited by <a href="http://daveduarte.co.za/">Dave Duarte</a> to give a presentation at the UCT Graduate School of Business (GSB) for their <a href="http://www.gsb.uct.ac.za/gsbwebb/EMEBrochure.asp?intpagenr=563">Nomadic Marketing</a> course. A very daunting task to say the least but I lapped up the opportunity to engage with some of SA's brilliant minds.
My presentation was on Tools & Technologies, Filtering and Collaborating and while the start is mostly around education the end of the presentation got very interesting. I figured that while it was important to explain the different tools and technologies out there I also wanted to show delegates how to use the tools effectively.
Having been privy to the delegate list beforehand I knew that there were a number of <a href="http://www.oldmutual.co.za">Old Mutual</a> people in the audience so I figured their company would be as good as any to do a small case study on. The results across the various social websites was interesting and I hope that it highlighted how companies are being spoken about online but also how the conversation is generally a one-way street. In my mind it's an opportunity to engage users and customers in a very unique way.
