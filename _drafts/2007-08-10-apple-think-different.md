In 2002 <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> created a new advertising campaign called Switch. It featured <em>real people</em> who had <em>switched</em> from the <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> Windows platform to the Mac.
Prior to this largely successful campaign Apple ran the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different">Think Different</a> campaign which was truly one of the best seen in the late 1990's. I had forgotten about this until I recently stumbled upon the original Think Different advert and because it's just brilliant I've included the ad below.
