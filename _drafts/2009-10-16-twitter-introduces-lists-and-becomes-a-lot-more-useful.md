  content: "TG they finally caught up....most of the apps - Tweetdeck / Seesmic etc
    have offered grouping options for quite a while. \r\n\r\nMakes a huge diff when
    you're trying to listen to a specific few in the crowd. I suspect twitter will
    continue to innovate their web interface to attract the 3rd party App users back."

  content: "Interesting that you mention trying to get 3rd party app users back to
    the site. Reason being, @stii noticed that Twitter haven't got any API documentation
    on the lists functionality yet they have \"other\" documentation for upcoming
    API features.\r\n\r\nMakes me wonder now if this list functionality is going to
    be released to 3rd party developers or not.\r\n\r\nI'd hope they do because I
    still prefer desktop applications to clicking refresh on a page..."

  content: "Isn't halve the problem with noise this strange habit of following those
    who follow you.  I follow you because you are interesting and then I got a request
    to follow me back - which I found strange.  Why did you do that? (I declined your
    request)\r\n\r\nNow with lists you will be able to put those you want to follow
    into a list. And those who you don't want to follow will be in another list.  If
    you follow me ...\r\n\r\nShouldn't you just be following your friends only in
    the first place?"

  content: "@Alan I have no idea....\r\n\r\n@Ian - I don't think I understand what
    you mean about the following back issue? \r\n\r\nThere is no wrong or right way
    to use Twitter. Some only follow a select few, others follow everyone who follow
    them. I'm somewhere inbetween - I checkout all my followers before I follow back.
    I don't like to follow spammers for example. With lists I can continue on this
    strategy but also filter the people I follow."

  content: "Wow! Good News! I agree with you, Twitter has become very noisy along
    with a lot of spam accounts! This feature is very welcome!\r\nSince I have no
    access to it yet, can you tell us if it's like \"communities\" on Gatorpeeps?"

    I'll keep my eye out..\r\n\r\nI can see this being VERY useful as my following
    count keeps climbing bit by bit."

  content: I expect them to come up with a feature to temporarily hide the tweets
    from certain people. I checked out brizzly.com, and they seem to have a best forward-integration
    of twitter.

<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/10/Screen-shot-2009-10-16-at-2.21.30-PM.png" alt="Twitter Sidebar with Lists" title="Twitter Sidebar with Lists" width="196" height="399" class="alignright size-full wp-image-861" />Twitter have today started rolling out a Beta feature to select users called Lists. To me this is the most useful feature that Twitter have added since they launched. I've had my Twitter account since March 2007 and during that time I've accumulated a whole bunch of followers. The problem with this is that Twitter has, over time, become far too noisy for me and I've lost my ability to follow what's going on.
As a result I've used Twitter more for updating than for following but Lists now change this. As you can see from my sidebar I can now create both public and private lists. This means that I can now create a private list just for friends and instead of seeing all the noise I can just view stuff from people that actually matter to me - my friends.
You can also see that I have created <a href="http://twitter.com/justinhartman/afrigator-team">an Afrigator Team list</a>. This list I made public so anyone can view this list and follow it if they want to. As with following individual Twitter profiles you can now follow a list and be updated on that lists stream which is pretty useful. What lists also do is allow you to know who are part of a team. Twitter have a <a href="http://twitter.com/twitter/team">team list</a> as well so you can now follow people from a company or cause that matter to you.
Twitter has just become a whole lot more useful to me and I think it's a game-changer! How many of you have access to Twitter Lists?
