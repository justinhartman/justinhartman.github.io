    do for Luke. He is as excited as you are, so you'll be doing Luke an injustice
    to keep him from seeing his bro. Go to another hospital where they don't mind.
    I remember at the Medi-clinic with Henk's birth, the brother were allowed to visit,
    but not other kids.

<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2008/04/parklane_hospital.jpg' alt='Netcare Park Lane Hospital' align='right' />With only days to go to the birth of my new son I find myself waiting in anticipation for that call from Colette to tell me it's time to go. 
Being a father for the second time round is even more daunting for me than the first but I'm nervously excited nonetheless.
It's been more than four years since Luke was born and we made a decision to utilise the services of the <a href="http://www.netcare.co.za/live/content.php?Item_ID=1533">Netcare Park Lane Clinic</a> once again for our newest arrival. 
We didn't actually have a very good experience with Park Lane when Luke was born, as the staff where really quite useless, however most people have great things to say about the hospital which is why we've decided to give them a second chance.
That said I am completely freaked out with Park Lane's (and Netcare in general) newest policy forcing us to pay <strong>R3,400 for the privilege</strong> to have Luke visit his mom and new brother. 
While one of the two wards is allocated to medical aid clients the other is for semi- and fully-private rooms which come at a premium. The catch here is that if Colette stays in the medical aid ward then no children are allowed at all while the private one allows siblings to visit in the room during visiting hours.
The cost for the semi-private room, which has 4 beds, is R800 per night and you have to pay for four nights upfront when checking in. If you wanted to go fully-private then that cost shoots up to R1,400 per night.
Now I understand that these private rooms are a luxury and come at a price and I'm not ignorant to this but what I fail to understand is why a sibling isn't allowed into the medical aid ward?
Seriously, what difference does is make to anyone if a sibling under 12 visits his mom and new brother in a ward with 12 beds? To me this is just a manipulative policy by Netcare to make more money out of us and it stinks if you ask me.
How am I supposed to tell Luke that he's not allowed to see his mom or brother for four days? It's already going to be such a stressful time for him and I simply can't do this to him so now I'm forced to fork out the money which I really can't afford.
Had we not already paid the R350 registration fee I would have sought an alternative hospital - not this casino that claims <em>I'm in safe hands</em>.
