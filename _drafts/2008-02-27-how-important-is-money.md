    outspoken and willing to say that I do think that money can make me happy. Firmly
    believe that. Money is my passion, I am passionate about business, blogging, writing,
    journalism and all of these things garner me.. you guessed it... more money.\r\n\r\nGood

  content: "Money certainly buys you comfort. Is comfort happiness?\r\n\r\nHappiness
    is not a commodity that can easily be bought; its not available on a store shelf
    somewhere. Happiness is so intangible. I cant walk up to you and say hey sell
    me some.\r\n\r\nHappiness is also very subjective - is it really all about being
    fuzzy and warm and smiley?\r\n\r\nHappiness is what you make it to be and how
    you choose to get it."

  content: "Nice points Garsen.\r\n\r\nFor me happiness is not warm and fuzzy but
    rather contentment. Unfortunately if you don't have money it's very difficult
    to be content with life because stress and pressure become the over-riding issues
    and this impacts on self-worth, relationships and many more.\r\n\r\nThat's why,
    for me, money is directly correlated to happiness."

    I took a huge salary drop to move to a startup where I am doing much more interesting
    work than my previous job. (My wife complains a bit though :)\r\n\r\nAs an aside
    have you read any of Paul Graham's essays on the subject? He distinguishes between
    money and wealth. The gist is that nobody really wants money, what they want is
    wealth and you can make wealth in other ways, although I haven't found out how
    yet ;)"

  content: "Hey Neville, good to see you on here :)\r\n\r\nJob satisfaction, and the
    essence of Paul Buchheit's post, is in most cases what we all should be striving
    for. I know from my own experience that this satisfaction far outweighs many of
    the \"benefits\" of a higher paid job - including money.\r\n\r\nI agree that Money
    and Wealth are two quite different issues and I'd certainly like to read Paul
    Graham's papers on this. I think my objective in life is not to be wealthy but
    to rather be content. As I've said before there are many factors that contribute
    to this contentment and money is one of them. \r\n\r\nI guess that we all have
    different objectives and priorities in life and while wealth is what I hope for
    in life I'm just as happy to be able to provide comfortably for my family.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and a new MacBook Air would be nice to have as well ;)"

    of freedom, I would agree with Justin 100% that money is a major source of happiness.
    Unfortunately, being a double-edged sword, money can also bring unhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt's
    that personal \"enough\" margin that needs to be found and balanced. And that,
    unfortunately, is the trick that most people don't get. The world media constantly
    blasts us with \"more ... More ... MORE!\", and people go for it. I believe it's
    called \"advertising\", lol.\r\n\r\nFor once, a sensible blog post about money.
    Quite amazing. Well done :)\r\n\r\n~ Wogan"

    the reason why i get out of bed in the morning.\r\nI live by the dream that one
    day, on my dying bed i will look back and smile at how i made this world a better
    place, how i've changed people lives for the better. I look around me all the
    time, it fills me with sadness, how so many people are too much money oriented,
    how they miss the fact that money is only material, it comes and goes and that
    what stays behind is our good deeds. I personally feel happier when i make others
    happy, and i don't mind spending my own money in order to do that ... \r\nI was
    never rich, neither i am now, nor do i think i will be, but i am happy the way
    i am ... i am thankful for the simplest things in life, health, love and family
    .... things you might not appreciate when you are spending your time chosing which
    dimond ring will look nicer around your manicured fingers, or which sports car
    will impress your friends the most ..."

  content: "$$$$$ every where you go, you need $$.. you can't live without that...\r\n\r\nWithout
    money we are not able to live... If we would be able to live without the money
    - why do we work, what for? I don't belive that some people work for their pleasure
    only... We work, we spent 8 hours or more in a work, we don't like our bosses,
    our boring offices - but we go there every day to earn money! of course money
    is not a thing that can make us happy, but we feel secure, safe and calm when
    we know that our bank account isn't empty... \r\n\r\nI think money not everything
    but that is most important other thing we need for our lives. \r\nIf you think
    about that a little , you know that when you havent health in your live what will
    happen? \r\nI think money is necessary for me but not all of my purpose in my
    live. \r\n\r\n\"With money you can buy a house but not a home;With money you can
    buy a clock but not time; With money you can buy a bed but not sleep; With money
    you can buy a book but not knowledge; With money you can buy a doctor but not
    health; With money you can buy a position but not respect; With money you can
    buy blood but not life; With money you can buy sex but not love.\" \r\n\r\nMoney
    isn't everything but... there are many but's... A simple example: witout money
    you can't have an internet, so you can't develop your language, what reduces to
    your unknown, and so on... \r\nIt should be enough money to study, to develop
    abilities and not to worry about the future. \r\n\r\nThanks"

    they miss the fact that money is only material, it comes and goes and that what
    stays behind is our good deeds. I personally feel happier when i make others happy,
    and i don&#39;t mind spending my own money in order to do that ... <br>I was never
    rich, neither i am now, nor do i think i will be, but i am happy the way i am
    ... i am thankful for the simplest things in life, health, love and family ....
    things you might not appreciate when you are spending your time chosing which
    dimond ring will look nicer around your manicured fingers, or which sports car
    will impress your friends the most ...

    money we are not able to live... If we would be able to live without the money
    - why do we work, what for? I don&#39;t belive that some people work for their
    pleasure only... We work, we spent 8 hours or more in a work, we don&#39;t like
    our bosses, our boring offices - but we go there every day to earn money! of course
    money is not a thing that can make us happy, but we feel secure, safe and calm
    when we know that our bank account isn&#39;t empty... <br><br>I think money not
    everything but that is most important other thing we need for our lives. <br>If
    you think about that a little , you know that when you havent health in your live
    what will happen? <br>I think money is necessary for me but not all of my purpose
    in my live. <br><br>"With money you can buy a house but not a home;With money
    you can buy a clock but not time; With money you can buy a bed but not sleep;
    With money you can buy a book but not knowledge; With money you can buy a doctor
    but not health; With money you can buy a position but not respect; With money
    you can buy blood but not life; With money you can buy sex but not love." <br><br>Money
    isn&#39;t everything but... there are many but&#39;s... A simple example: witout
    money you can&#39;t have an internet, so you can&#39;t develop your language,
    what reduces to your unknown, and so on... <br>It should be enough money to study,
    to develop abilities and not to worry about the future. <br><br>Thanks'

I read a very interesting blog post by Paul Buchheit titled <a href="http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2007/12/is-there-more-to-life-than-money.html">Is there more to life than money?</a> which got me thinking about whether money directly relates to happiness.
Paul is an ex-Googler who was the creative genius behind <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">AdSense</a> and suggested the company's now-famous motto <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">Don't be evil</a></em>. He left Google in June last year and is now an angel investor and founder of the startup <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a>.
The context of Paul's post stirs up a couple of interesting issues, namely;
<ul>
<li>Will you make more money working for a startup?</li>
<li>Does money make you happy?</li>
<li>Love what you do - even if you are in a 9-5 job.</li>
</ul>
There is a lot more to his post but these are the core points of interest I took from it.
Many will argue that money is an object that, while making life a little easier, doesn't or can't buy happiness - my view is slightly different and I think I've had enough education in this regard.
Here's my take, in the simplest form:- <strong>when I had money life was never better and when I didn't have it I couldn't cope with life</strong>.
I think it's very easy to say money isn't important when you've got a lot of it but when you haven't got it, it's the most stressful part of living life. Financial burden is the <strong>#1 stress</strong> in the United States and I would imagine that South Africa is not far off that.
I do subscribe to the notion that money isn't everything but I also believe that it is a major, critical facet of life today. If we can take the <em>need for money</em> out of our life's equation then we will be free to live life as it's meant to be lived but as long as it remains a means for survival nobody can tell me money isn't important or doesn't create an immense amount of unhappiness and stress.
Financial freedom = Happiness
