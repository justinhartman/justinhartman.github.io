On Saturday evening the iPhone-dev team <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/42858313/thanks-for-waiting">release PwnageTool 2.0</a> for Mac (<a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/42931306/pwnagetool-2-0-1">version 2.0.1</a> has now been released as well).
This new version jailbreaks and hacks any 1st or 2nd Generation iPhone so you now have the ability to run the latest iPhone firmware 2.0.
When I tried to hack my version 1.1.4 iPhone with the PwnageTool I couldn't get the damn application to pick up the latest 2.0 firmware file. It turned out that I had downloaded the 3G firmware instead of the 1st Gen firmware and <a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=1557">this great tutorial</a> from iClarified really helped seal the deal for me.
The hack took about 25 minutes and was easy to do once I had all the correct files and I'm now officially running firmware version 2.0 (5A347) on my Vodacom SIM card without any problems.
A couple of interesting observations about the new firmware:
<ul>
<li>Under the Phone settings you can now use all the forwarding, call waiting and caller ID functions.</li>
<li>Under that same menu is a Vodacom4me link... I wonder if this in preparation for iPhone launch in SA?</li>
<li>All my settings were localised to South Africa - and this was before I set the phone up in iTunes.</li>
<li>AppStore is awesome and I have Google, Apple Remote, Twitterific, Facebook, iYardage and Last.fm apps downloaded and running.</li>
<li>Install.app is no longer available in 2.0. Instead, Cydia is the new "illegal" application manager and it runs off Debian Apt - VERY NICE!</li>
<li>Google Maps actually works!!!! It pin-points me to my current location (which is a little inaccurate) and I don't even have the GPS on my iPhone. It must use the Vodacom cell towers for this but I am super impressed that it works for the first time.</li>
<li>You still can't forward an SMS........ and there is no copy and paste functions. Have Apple learnt nothing about basic phone functionality?</li>
</ul>
That's it for now. Not sure if I'm the first SA hack but I'm loving it nonetheless.
