<img align="right" src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/04/n561188397_124957_3194.jpg" alt="Bolton Deventer" />When I was formulating my presentation for the <a href="http://mdw.typepad.com/ai/2009/04/writing-workshop-for-bloggers.html">24.com Blogging Workshop</a> on Saturday I was struggling to find a good example of how to promote your blog and market yourself online. So, I decided it was time to revive <a href="http://webtrafficmaker.wordpress.com/">Bolton Deventer</a>.
I figured that Bolton had a massive impact on the South African blogging community so what better way to illustrate this than by using him as a case study. I must say that I had massive amounts of fun putting this presentation together as it reminded me of the shenanigans that went on during that brief twelve day period. If you haven't heard of Bolton then best you view the presentation below and get some tips on how to grow traffic to your blog!
