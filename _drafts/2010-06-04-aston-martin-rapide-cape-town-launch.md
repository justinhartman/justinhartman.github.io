Yesterday evening I had the opportunity to attend the Cape Town launch of the <a href="http://www.astonmartin.co.za/content.asp?subID=50">Aston Martin Rapide</a> all thanks to <a href="http://www.justinstanford.com/">Justin Stanford</a>. Aston Martin has long been an aspirational brand for me personally and I've had my eye on the DB9 for a long time now. I guess, however, that the biggest issue with owning a DB9 is the practicality of having more than two passengers. Well the Rapide now solves this issue...

The Rapide is arguably the most beautiful four door sports car in the world and is powered by Aston Martin's hand built 6.0-litre V12 engine from the DB9. From the DBS the Rapide has inherited the suspension and combined this adds up to an impressive and practical sports car that blew my mind away.

Sitting in the Rapide is an experience to behold and it feels like you're in a F1 car - only far more comfortable and stylish. All four seats are independent from each other and in true Aston Martin style they have all been hand stitched. The Rapide boasts a <a href="http://www.bang-olufsen.com/aston-martin-rapide">1000w Bang & Olufsen</a> sound system that is just as impressive as the interior itself.
The boot space in the Rapide is mind-boggling and there is so much space that it's now completely conceivable that you can take the wife and kids on a seaside holiday in this car.

With a starting price of around R2.7 million it makes for a hefty chunk of change but as a consolation every Aston Martin now comes with a full maintenance plan as of 1 May 2010. At the Gauteng launch I think they sold four Rapides on the night (including a One 77) and I'm keen to know how many more were sold last night.
The only thing left for me to do now is to organise a test drive which may, or may not, be a good thing. For more pictures from the event and of the car <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/sets/72157624200744718/">click here</a>.
