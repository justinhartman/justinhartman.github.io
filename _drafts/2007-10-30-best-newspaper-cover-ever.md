I know this is very belated but time has not been on my side however I think this cover is timeless. Originally published in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/">The Independent</a> on the morning of the Rugby World Cup Final this front page moved me and is the best cover I've ever seen yet there is barely a picture on it. If you can't read the writing click on the image for a larger version.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=1794117797&size=l" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2048/1794117797_f13f207264.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Best newspaper cover ever" /></a>
If you didn't get it (I didn't on the first time) this is all about England. The Independent would have all of us believe this is about SA but the clever play on words ring true to what has been happening of late in the UK.
The part that really interests me is that while our politicians are all complaining about transformation in South African sport there isn't a single country that isn't plagued with similar issues. Bloggers, the media and even political stalwarts have all agreed that politics should be left out of sport and this cover I think, highlights just how shallow these transformation claims are in our country.
