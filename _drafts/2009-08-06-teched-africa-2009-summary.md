<a href="http://www.teched.co.za">TechEd Africa 2009</a>, Microsoft's pinnacle conference that attracted more than 2000 delegates has ended amongst a hive of activity within the Microsoft community. Microsoft sure does know how to get its users and developers excited by the prospect of new software, approaches and company developments!
Attending the conference was an interesting experience and I have to admit that it was extremely difficult to decide on a focus area at TechEd. From a myriad of topic choices, from information security to product overviews, and self-paced hot labs, Tech-Ed offered us a unique perspective into what the future holds for the company.
As mentioned in an earlier post live demos proved to be a problem throughout the conference. While I get the need to do these live demos bandwidth constraints and software problems hindered the impact of the message but in the end we got the information we needed.
I was particularly interested in the discussions around IE8, PHP for Windows, Windows 7 and Silverlight 3. Of them all I must say I think Silverlight is certainly an interesting product worth watching as it allows native developers to create applications relatively easily.
Microsoft is also embracing the future in cloud computing, through the creation of Windows Azure, designed to enable application developers and users with better access and less capital outlay in application development and deployment. I seriously doubt that cloud computing is viable in Africa right now but nonetheless Microsoft feels differently.
While it may have been difficult for me at times to find my place within the TechEd community I can certainly see this community thriving. Microsoft has done a fantastic job at entrenching themselves within the corporate/enterprise market and this is evident by the varying array of delegates at the conference.
It's that sense of community that made networking relatively easy at TechEd. From the opening party, to the informal gatherings round lunchtime drinks, to the closing party featuring Louise Carver, we've certainly had a fantastic time.
So, thanks, TechEd, for giving us the opportunity to explore and evaluate an environment and working atmosphere that has not been our own. I'm not sure if we're ready to drop Apple and Linux just yet but it's certainly been a great ride.
