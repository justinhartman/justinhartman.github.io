  content: Hahaha! Oh man, indeed I do! Mambo really lost face after pulling a dirty
    one a couple of years back. Really sad that these things happen in the open source
    community but indeed they do. But at the end of the day it's always the right
    party that prevails (or so I believe).

OK well the title is not 100% accurate however the following screenshot was taken off the official <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo</a> website.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/1261728239/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1342/1261728239_e1d614d36f.jpg" alt="Mambo vs. Joomla!" /></a>
You can't really read the text all that well however if you click on it you'll see an article about the inaugural Open Source Content Management System Awards and this quote is taken directly from the Mambo website.
<blockquote>"Following 72 nominations and 15,000 votes, Joomla! was eventually declared the winner."
</blockquote>
Now for those of you who don't know <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla!</a> is the off-shoot of the Mambo Open Source CMS project. The two parted ways some time ago due to irreconcilable differences and since then Joomla! has far surpassed Mambo in the innovation and development front.
Our very own <a href="http://charlvn.za.net/">Charl van Niekerk</a> was <a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/04/google-soc-accepted.html">recently accepted</a> into the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> for his project for Joomla! (which he's <a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2007/08/joomla-jxhtml-demo-source-code.html">now finished</a>) and I think he'd certainly appreciate the humour in this.
