Two weeks ago Colette slipped on some wet tiles at our home and hurt her foot really badly. We thought the foot was broken but after further investigation the doctors realized that it was just badly infected. 
The net result after three days in the hospital is that I'm waiting for her to now come out of surgery. Being 29 weeks pregnant the doctors really wanted to avoid this but alas, here I sit - a nervous wreck. 
I'm just hoping all goes well and that Colette and my baby are going to be ok.
