    feel the usual keyboard under my fingers makes the whole process of using it weird.
    I am about to try it out. It should help a lot.\r\n\r\nThanks again! ;-)"

    with the 3-pronged option? I always plug in with a 3-pronged adapter and/or 3-pronged
    extension cable, but still get very mild zaps every now and then, so was just
    wandering if I was the only one for whom this solution doesn't actually work.

  content: Alex, the round 2 prong plug is a French adapter. In France they have a
    single rod coming out from the socket which acts as the earth but in SA we don't
    have that. If you cut the round 2 prong plug off the cord you will see 3 wires
    and you just wire them to the 3 prong. Issue solved :)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/1631153160/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2019/1631153160_e0889d7d7c_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="MacBook Pro" align="right" /></a>This post, unfortunately, is not nearly as thought provoking as dealing with the <a href="http://tinylink.co.za/640f58">death of Lucky Dube</a> however I thought this info might help some fellow <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> (MBR) users.
Ever since I got my MBR I've been getting small electric shocks from the body casing of my computer while it's plugged on the charger. The interesting thing about this though is that this only ever happened at home and when it was on the charger at work I never had an issue.
Thinking that the issue was related to my electrical supply at home I spent a good few months trying to plug the machine into different plugs, adding it to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply">UPS</a> and even trying to change plugs that came with the machine itself. Alas, I still got shocked.
I posted this on twitter, after being the lucky recipient of a big surge of electricity up my arm, and lucky for me <a href="http://armanddp.net/">Armand</a> was there to help. It seems that this is a <a href="http://tinylink.co.za/911fb2">very common problem</a> and the solution is really simple. According to <a href="http://tinylink.co.za/e9fdaa">AppleDefects</a> the only real fix is to replace the 2-prong plug with an earthed 3-prong plug which I tried immediately.
I'm pleased to report that since making the "switch" I haven't experienced another shock again. Seems that while the Titanium casing on the MBR is super cool it can also provide for some shocking experiences.
