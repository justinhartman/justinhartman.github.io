    - there are no people in the logo!!<br>You people take the first opportunity to
    demolish a brand. South Africans are fickle - and while we enjoy freedom of speech,
    we only create pessimistic impressions. Gee thanks to PNP for even trying to better
    themselves for the greater public. Get a grip people

  content: I found this post and this entire discussion hilarious. Grant&#39;s right,
    there&#39;s no malice here, they were just super lazy!

Earlier this month <a href="http://www.picknpay.co.za/">Pick n Pay</a> spent a bucket-load of money on a new corporate identity. Groogle <a href="http://groogle.co.za/2007/11/12/pick-n-pay-makes-a-web-20-move/">was perplexed</a> as to why the R110 million didn't include a re-branding of the Pick n Pay website which did seem strange at the time.
I'm pleased to say that Pick n Pay finally got their act together and their new website, with new <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>-clone logo, has been launched. 
Only one small problem - seems like Pick n Pay don't think white people matter anymore.
Have a look at the old banner below (thanks <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Groogle</a>):

And now look at the new one (thanks to <a href="http://nicharalambous.com">Nic</a> for pointing this out):

That's a real kick in the teeth if you ask me! Not only did Pick n Pay feel the need to spend the R110 million in the United Kingdom and deprive this economy of some much needed cash but they also decided to exclude all white people from their demographic makeup.
<em>Inspired by you</em>? Whatever...
