  content: Just goes to show what state this country is really in. They should ban
    all black taxi's, start by searching every single one of them which will probably
    result in finding 90% of them not legal and carrying weapons. It's like the world
    owes them something. They are like leaches and believe that they are above the
    law. Even our pathetic BEE police service are to scared to challenge them. We
    should go back to "managing" these black taxi's like we did in the 70's and 80's.
    It's the only way, as they have proved to be incompotent of doing it themselves
    in a normal human society.

  content: I agree with Bart. I now live near Stellies because I got "gatvol" of these
    animals in the city. Cant we bring back corporal punishment for these animals?
    I was pushed off the road once, now I own a big-ass 4X4 and I dont budge for them.
    In fact, I go out of my way to push them off the road, scratch their taxi's with
    the bull-bar etc. Just like giving them what they normally try and dish out.

  content: Can't we just makes these types of people just disappear? With the BRT
    they don't do anything for the economy, and how are tourists going to feel when
    they see the host country of the biggest sporting event in the world has people
    like this running around freely. Kudo's to the police though. From what I heard
    they were quick in cleaning out the situation.

Driving to work this morning I heard that about 100 taxis were driving from the N2 into the Cape Town CBD in a protest to the introduction of the government's Bus Rapid Transit system. Seeing as the Afrigator office appears to have the best position for chaos in the city (see the pics from the <a href="http://stii.co.za/cape-town/bus-burns-in-cape-town/">bus burning from our balcony</a>) I figured it would be a matter of time before they made their way past us.
They didn't disappoint. (see more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/tags/taxi/">pics here</a>)
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/tags/taxi/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3047/3095186722_93a3b2a27d.jpg" alt="Taxi Protest in Cape Town" /></a>
The only thing that worries me now is that there have already been reports of <a href="http://news.iafrica.com/sa/1368460.htm">cars being stoned</a> by the protesters and with all the riot police around you just get a sense that this is a situation just waiting to explode.
