    about quite frankly - they haven't turned a profit EVER.

  content: "i agree: and would further this by offering the following:\r\n\r\n1.try
    getting an explanation why a short flight between port elizabeth costs more than
    the full price of kulula or 1 time between durban and cape town. there simply
    is no justification, for the complete and utter monopoly rip off of our tax money.\r\n\r\n2.
    mango have the worst website, it is completely disfunctional. if you call the
    c...s at the call center, you will feel the aggression, you will have  your time
    and the cost of the call wasted...at maxi call rates. you will be left feeling
    humiliated. no wonder...they dont care,,,,they get bailed out! service? who cares!
    ask chantel, yusuf, and sebi.\r\n\r\n3. the fact that the dalai lama was refused
    a visa to a peace conference prompts me to urge all travellers within and to south
    africa: DONT USE SAA OR MANGO!  they are state sponsored airlines: We should not
    support them, becuase our South African state sponsors the likes of mugabe, kadafi....real
    peace loving men, i dont think!\r\nrather use 1 time and kulula..you wont get
    abused, the websites work...simple and easy."

What do you get when you...
&bull; ...install a brand new WordPress instance on a fancy <a href="http://saasucks.com">new domain name</a>?
&bull; ...steal <a href="http://www.flysaa.com">FlySAA</a>'s home page banner and insert it into the WordPress default theme?
&bull; ...do a <a href="http://www.google.co.za/search?q=%22saa+sucks%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">Google search</a> for other people who've complained about SAA?
The answer... <a href="http://saasucks.com">SAA Sucks</a>.
<a href="http://saasucks.com"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/10/picture-5-500x228.png" alt="" title="South African Airlines Sucks" width="500" height="228" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-358" /></a>
Seriously though, the whole <a href="/2008/10/21/saa-extortion-at-its-best/">getting ripped off experience</a> I've recently gone through with <a href="http://saasucks.com">South African Airways</a> has really hit me hard. What's more is that I've realised that not only do most people feel the same way but many have gone through similar experiences.
Added to this, my letter of demand to Khaya Ngqula (CEO of <a href="http://saasucks.com">SAA</a>) seems to have fallen on deaf ears and I've been left with a bad taste in my mouth ever since.
Thanks to <a href="http://gregorrohrig.com">Gregor</a> for giving me the idea to do a site around this and in a short space of time I managed to get SAA Sucks up and running. The idea behind it is to dedicate space on the interwebs for anyone to go and complain about <a href="http://saasucks.com">SAA</a>. 
It is clear that <a href="http://saasucks.com">SAA</a> are living in complete arrogance and have a total disregard for their clients and I think we need to take a stand. I've been a big pundit of the power of social media and now we can really put it to the test and see if we can make any difference whatsoever.
So while SAA Sucks is now live it's up to you guys to help me spread the word. Write a blog post about it, send the link to your Facebook friends, post it on Twitter, Google bomb SAA with a link to SAA Sucks, frankly I don't care - just spread the word. 
Finally, If there are <a href="http://www.robinpietersen.com/">any</a> <a href="http://www.markforrester.co.za/">designers</a> <a href="http://foxinni.com/">out</a> <a href="http://coda.co.za/">there</a> who'd like to do a <em>proper theme</em> for this site let me know - it could do with something decent!
