Yesterday I happened to notice two <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">Sunday Times</a> newspapers lying next to each other. One was from 30 September 2007 while the other was the latest edition printed on Sunday 22 June 2008.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/2607150906/sizes/l/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3263/2607150906_1b073ed673.jpg" alt="Sunday Times Strap" /></a>
In the space of just nine short months the cost of the Sunday Times has increased considerably in each of the following countries.
<strong>South Africa</strong>
September 2007 = R9.95
June 2008 = R12.50
Difference = R2.55
<strong>Botswana</strong>
September 2007 = P11.40
June 2008 = P13.50
Difference = P2.10
<strong>Namibia</strong>
September 2007 = N$14.20
June 2008 = N$16.90
Difference = N$2.70
<strong>Zimbabwe</strong>
September 2007 = $45,000
June 2008 = $800,000,000
Difference = $799,955,000
I don't know how the poor <a href="http://afrigator.com/topics/zimbabwecrisis">Zimbabweans must feel</a> however with the rising cost of food, petrol and general day to day expenses it's almost not viable to buy a paper in this country anymore.
