    they can get all the eyeballs in the world for free and only pay when people click
    their ads - that's like...free exposure bru. Also (and I haven't tried your program
    out yet) but it seems like Google has just launched AdPlanner (http://adwords.blogspot.com/2008/06/introducing-google-ad-planner.html)
    and that's providing targeting that's a lot more acute than yours. \r\n\r\nYou
    also haven't mentioned display opportunities in your program - are blogs going
    to have gadget type ads on them?  Do blogs need to be ajax friendly?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  content: "Whale- Search ads and Display ads are two very distinctly different advertising
    methods. Search will almost always be used for direct response, whilst the type
    of ad budgets Adgator are after are most certainly branding. Google ads (display)
    are trash ads in my opinion. Bottom of the barrel advertisers- definitely not
    the established brands Adgator are hoping to coax onto the long tail.\r\n\r\nTherefore
    Adgator cannot be compared to Google in any way. \r\n\r\nIf I had to guess Adgators
    competition (I don't know the make-up of the SA landscape all that well.)I'd say
    it was established offline publishers who have an online presence- Newspaper and
    magazine titles. \r\n\r\nSince the beast that is Naspers has a stake in Afrigator
    I'd hazard a guess that it's not going to be hard for some test spend to be diverted
    Adgators way by the sales guys."

  content: "Whale: - I'm with Grant on this one. Firstly let me state categorically
    that we are most DEFINITELY NOT Google. I'd like to be Google, but alas we have
    a long way to go in terms of Technology, product offering and credibility.\r\n\r\nI
    (along with Grant I think) am not negating that big brands use Google and the
    CPC model does work for them. However, there is a very specific reason why Google
    introduced CPM to Adwords - because corporates wanted it.\r\n\r\nGoogle changed
    the landscape with targeted CPC - it's the reason they're the 5th largest company
    in the US - however that doesn't necessarily change the markets need.\r\n\r\nIn
    South Africa traditional advertisers understand CPM and quite frankly don't yet
    get CPC. There are exceptions to this but only time and education will really
    change the mindset shift from CPM to CPC.\r\n\r\nWith Adgator - we're hoping to
    speak to a language that traditional advertisers understand and for now that language
    is CPM. The market will shift and when it does we'll have to re-evaluate the CPM
    model."

  content: "Thanks Whale- \r\n\r\nI think we need to understand what is meant by a
    'branding' client here. Outsurance and FNB (for the most part) are not what I
    would call 'branding' clients. Big brands-yes, but their ad spend is for the most
    part not focussed on a branding aspect, they're focussed on a direct response,
    eg: \"lowest premiums\", \"High interest rates\"...Click here!\r\n\r\nA branding
    client will be, Coca-Cola, Samsung, Alcohol brands, etc. Their ads aren't meant
    to make you rush out and buy their product straight away. Their supposed to coax
    you into believing that when you're thirsty you drink Coke,  when you want to
    have fun you pour a Smirnoff, and only Samsung TV's make films come alive. \r\n\r\nIt's
    these branding clients budgets that Adgator is after. And these budgets are not
    spent on a CPC basis. These ads are effective whether people click on them or
    not. \r\n\r\nWhat I meant by trash ads... is that google has such a high volume
    of inventory that they ultimately have to fill their ads with something. This
    remnant inventory (which Google display ads often are to start with) is usually
    characterised by low paying advertisers.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question- \"Why
    would users pay CPM when they can get the same impression share and pay CPC on
    Google's Content network?\"\r\nI think you meant advertisers here. And the
    simple reason is that, I, as a site owner do not want low quality, low cost ads
    on my site. Therefore I use Adgator who ensure that only quality, relevent, high
    yielding ads are placed on my site. In doing so if an advertiser wants to have
    their ads on my site so they can advertise to my audience. Then they have to pay
    a premium CPM. If they want to pay CPC then they can go somewhere else. Why should
    I as the site owner bere all the risk of putting ads on the site and hope that
    someone clicks on them. What if Outsurance want to target the users on my site
    but my users don't like Outsurance... who suffers- me, who makes money- not me.\r\n\r\nI
    think Justin answered your question regarding the comparisons with Google.\r\n\r\nI
    don't mean to come across as harsh here, I just hope I'm getting my point across.
    There is so much more that can be said to highlight the nature of online advertising
    and the reasons why CPC (PPC), CPM, and CPA exist. Each serve their own purpose
    and must be seen as tools to achieve types of results. This is why companies hire
    agencies and sites hire sales houses.\r\n\r\nG"

In December 2007 I did a presentation at <a href="http://27dinner.com/">27dinner</a> in Jo'burg where I previewed the first Beta version of <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>. Most people at the time thought we were going to announce an acquisition but alas it really was just geeky from start to end.
One of the key points I raised in the presentation (sideshow <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/justinhartman/afrigatorcom-beta-launch-presentation-181902">here</a>, video <a href="http://www.zoopy.com/video/detail/id/6137/">here</a>) was that we were going to implement a revenue model for the website and in turn share the revenue with the bloggers. <a href="http://ramonthomas.com/">Ramon</a> was the first person to ask how we planned on doing this but at the time we were still unclear as to the model and in truth it's taken us almost 11 months to figure this one out.
Enter <a href="http://adgator.co.za">Adgator</a> - a <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2008/11/11/afrigator-launches-adgatorafrigator-launches-adgator/">newly launched</a> product, under the Afrigator stable, that links our blogging network to advertisers and helps to monetise blogs in a way that <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense">Google Adsense</a> and other forms of online marketing simply can't do.
<a href="http://adgator.co.za"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/11/picture-1-500x374.png" alt="" title="Adgator - Africa's first Blog Advertising Network" width="500" height="374" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-405" /></a>
The more I've been watching the collective growth of our network the more I've come to realise just how powerful blogs are in relation to other traditional websites. As an example, the top 100 blogs in South Africa (as measured by Afrigator) account for more than 1.7 million unique users and serves over 5.6 million page views each month.
This makes the network as powerful in terms of audience reach to South Africa's #1 local website, <a href="http://www.news24.com">News24</a>, which also serves around 1.7 million uniques each month <em>~ (Nielsen Netratings - Q2 June 2008)</em>.
The scary part for me is that more than 1,200 blogs registered on Afrigator haven't implemented our tracking code so they can't be added to these figures and if you had to add them to the mix I have little doubt the network would look a whole lot different.
So, with a total network cap of 3.2 million unique users and 7.9 million page views I've often wondered how we can use this network to all of our advantage and I believe <a href="http://adgator.co.za">Adgator</a> is the answer to this pondering.
The concept of Adgator is simple. Sign up as a blogger, insert a piece of code into your blog theme and we'll go out and find advertisers who are willing to spend money. Each time a blogger sees one of our ads on their website they know that they've made money. Initially we'll be sticking to a CPM model because that's what advertisers understand and we will share 50% of the revenue with bloggers.
This model means that a blog serving as little as 2,500 page views a month can make R300 for doing nothing and if you're lucky enough to be a high-traffic blog your earnings could be as high as six figures. Our aim with Adgator is to be as transparent as possible and all blog owners will have their own access to our system so they can track their earnings in real time. In our reporting we break down cost, revenue share and total income so the blogger knows exactly who's getting what.
As an advertiser or media planner the value proposition is easy to quantify. Without realising it at the time Afrigator has been indexing, filtering, categorising and profiling blogs in a way that is perfectly tailored for this business model. Instead of throwing a banner up on a major traffic website we can now offer real, targeted advertising to markets and audiences that fit an advertisers' needs perfectly.
Adgator excites me in a way I can't describe. The possibilities are endless really but to start off we've invited 100 of SA's top blogs to the network for a pilot program. Invitations were sent this morning and we're in the process of finalising some exciting advertisers that will really compliment the product and blogs that the creatives appear on.
In the first quarter of 2009 we plan to implement this blog ad network in Kenya and Nigeria so watch this space for more details on these announcements.
If you're a South African blogger and you didn't get an invite but want to be a part of the network please visit <a href="http://adgator.co.za">the site</a> and <a href="http://adgator.co.za/blog-account.php">sign up</a>. We're certainly not going to limit the network to 100 blogs and the quicker we can build the network the better.
I'm sure you'll have some questions, please feel free to ask me anything...
