    so you can see the room and other areas of the hotel. The quality isn't great
    as they were all taken with my camera phone but you'll get the idea.

This week I was lucky enough to attend a great <a href="http://www.interactiveafrica.com/assets/iaezines/invite_D&AD_cpt.htm">digital workshop</a> in Cape Town, hosted by <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a>, featuring Simon Waterfall from Poke in London. My accommodation for the night was at the <a href="http://www.extreme-hotels.com/">Extreme Hotel</a> in Bree Street and it's an awesome hotel to say the least.
To give you an idea here are two pictures I took on Thursday morning of the smoking room in the hotel. Not sure if this is funny or just plain scary...
