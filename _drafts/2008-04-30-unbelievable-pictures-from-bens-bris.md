    He's 13 now and wears a size 9 shoe. Hard to believe they were once so small.

On Tuesday we had a very small gathering for little Ben's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bris">Bris</a> ceremony. While no parent likes to watch their son's penis being cut to shreds I have to say it all went down very well and I managed to keep the tears to myself!
I'm a very fortunate guy as I know a professional photographer in <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a> and he happily obliged to take a few happy snaps on the day. The results simply blew us all away.
I knew the pictures would be good because I love Gregor's style but honestly I didn't expect to be moved so emotionally as I was when I first saw them. Gregor is without doubt a very talented boy and I've included the pictures for you to see below. If you want to view a slideshow of the event then <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/sets/72157604810640111/show/">visit this link</a>.
Thanks to everyone who could make it to this special event in our lives - it meant a great deal to all of us.
