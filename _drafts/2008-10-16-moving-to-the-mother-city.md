    end of last year, my wife and I know what you guys are going through. It is really
    not easy, especially for children.  Almost 12 months in and we are still finding
    it hard at times. Best way to look at it is as an adventure! Besides, there are
    worse places to end up than Cape Town.

It's been 13 days since I shipped my entire family down to Cape Town and what an experience it has been. We've gone from this chaos in Johannesburg:-
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/10/img_1682-500x333.jpg" alt="Image" title="Boxes and boxes ready to leave our house in Johannesburg" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-327" />
To this ordered chaos in our new home in Cape Town:-
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/10/img_1796-500x333.jpg" alt="Image" title="New home in Cape Town" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-328" />
I have to say that moving to a new city is really not as easy as it seems and proved to be an immense challenge for all of us. 
When we knew that we'd have to move it really seemed like an awesome idea at the time. I mean, who wouldn't want to move to a city with reduced crime, beautiful oceans, mountains and a better overall quality of life?
While I am not regretting the move at all I didn't/couldn't anticipate how trying this would be both emotionally and physically to all of us - including the people we left behind. Packing boxes is no fun, unpacking even less, but the really difficult aspect has been the emotional loss of our families and friends.
As adults, Colette and I are able to understand our emotions and deal with them accordingly but what we've found with Luke, our five year old, is that this is not so easy to do. While Luke is content about 90% of the time there are moments when he's tired and run down and it's then that he yearns for his family and our domestic worker left in Johannesburg.
This is gut wrenching stuff for us but we've just tried to make it fun for him to try and mitigate the loneliness and heart-ache he's experiencing.
On the work front I'm loving every minute of being involved in a startup. These are exciting times for <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> and at the moment we've been working hard on setting up relationships with people here in Cape Town as well as working on some interesting developments for the website and community.
There is a new and different kind of stress being involved in <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> but at the end of the day I'm doing this for myself which makes it very motivating and highly exciting. I really think we're going to do some awesome things over the next two years.
Finally, on the blog front, I've decided to change my writing style and theme somewhat. Moving forward this blog will highlight my experiences running a startup which I'm doing mainly to alleviate some of the stress and I'll also be writing more about my personal life and the adjustment to life after Jo'burg.
In short this blog is about startups, technology and life and you can expect this to be the core focus moving forward. Not sure how much I can post these days as things are pretty busy but I'll do what I can when I can.
