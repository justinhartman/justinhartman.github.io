Lolly Jackson, owner of Teazers, has just purchased himself a brand new <a href="http://www.koenigsegg.com/cars_1_1.html">Koenigsegg CCX</a> super-car at a whopping R14 million. This makes the Koenigsegg almost double the price of a Ferrari Enzo...
South Africa will receive 3 of the 30 cars made a year and I wonder who the other two cars are going to. Personally I don't like the Koenigsegg and I'd much rather own an <a href="http://groogle.co.za/2008/03/26/out-to-lunch-with-david-bullard-and-the-audi-r8/">Audi R8</a> (or 10 at the price of the Koenigsegg) but it's something to behold nonetheless.
