<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2008/03/ilab-logo.png' alt='Avusa iLab Logo' />
Finally I can now officially announce that I've left <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> and have taken up a new position as the Digital Innovation Manager at <a href="http://www.avusa.co.za">Avusa</a>'s new commercial applications unit known as the iLab.
The iLab was formed to create online, offline and mobile innovation within the Avusa group and I'll be heading up a small team from this point onwards. I will still report directly to <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za">Colin</a>, who is now the Publisher of Times Online, but he will also work very closely with us on the strategy and implementation of new products and services.
We've also been busy with recruiting new staff and I'm very excited that <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a> has joined the iLab, in a highly strategic role, as our New Media Specialist. We're really going to diversify Gregor's skills and it is without doubt that he'll be an invaluable addition to the team.
From the 1st of April <a href="http://www.ian-judiet.za.net/blog/">Ian Barnes</a> will join the iLab team as our Lead PHP Developer and I'm really excited to have his skill-set on board. Ian was responsible for the development of the <a href="http://www.vault9.net/">Vault9</a> network as well as the blog traffic exchange site <a href="http://www.blogmad.net/">Blog Mad</a>, so he has a proven track record in delivering high-quality websites.
There is little doubt that we're building up a formidable team in the iLab and we're not done just yet. We're still on the lookout for a killer Web/Multimedia Graphic Designer so if you want to work with an innovative, dynamic and super-cool bunch of guys then <a href="mailto:hartmanj@thetimes.co.za">pop me an email</a>.
Exciting times at Avusa and I'm looking forward to reporting on some of our developments in the coming weeks and months.
