    had to come up with several k for each birth (both were natural, I shudder to
    think what a C-section would have cost us).

  content: On thinkmoney.co.za just make sure you look at the amount of reviews and
    make sure to look at the natural reviews, not the sponsored ones which come up
    on top. There's a couple of good ones as rated by their members. Surprisingly,
    Bonitas which was found to be the inudustry leader in a survey last year, doesn't
    far that well in thinkmoney's user reviews.

One of my reasons for moving to <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> was the lucrative medical aid offer from <a href="http://www.discovery.co.za">Discovery Life</a>. Having not been on a Medical Aid for more than 12 months this was quite a critical issue for me as family medical costs have to be a top priority.
In recent weeks Luke had a <a href="/2007/10/24/making-a-grown-man-cry/">minor operation</a> and Colette had an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnio">Amniocentesis</a> to test for downs-syndrome in our unborn son.
I've just received my medical aid statement for November from Discovery and below is a breakdown of the costs incurred.
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/11/discovery_statement1.png' alt='Discovery Statement' />
You can see that the total cost for both procedures was R9,024.09. Of that I have to pay R4,271.99 and an amount of R2,085.43 was paid directly from my savings account. This means that Discovery's total liability was only R2,666.67 - the rest is paid using <strong>my money</strong>.
Now I might be missing the point here but how is it possible that a medical aid company only covers 29.5% of <strong>hospital procedures</strong>? It's not like we went to some designer optician and spent R9,000 on matching his and her glasses - these were both hospital induced costs and I find myself paying more than 70% of the total bill.
I'm wondering if a hospital plan is not a better option for me seeing as I pay a fortune for Discovery each month and ultimately end up paying most of bills anyway?
Pathetic!
