  content: "Great job Justin. I picked up on your slides late last night before you
    posted. ;)\r\n\r\nOne thing I would like to discuss though is the 'registered
    users' statistics. We saw a drop between November, December and January and an
    increase in February. Those figures are actually active registered users over
    a 30 day period. So we might only have seen 2 000 new users and the rest were
    just purely in inactive due to the festive season. A lot people went back to work,
    university and school from mid January.\r\n\r\nGreat presentation though, what
    are you using to create your graphs?"

In November last year I did a <a href="/2007/11/19/redcube-presentation-on-multimedia-and-social-media-2/">presentation on Multimedia and Social Media</a> to the RedCube PR agency and in it I looked at South Africa's total registered users on Facebook as well as where we ranked against other countries in the world.
This was a very interesting exercise so I figured that it might be interesting to expand on this and explore the stats available on South Africa. I've now created the first of hopefully a monthly report and you can view the stats in greater detail below, <a href="/assets/images/uploads/2008/02/sa-facebook-stats-february-2008.pdf">download the PDF version</a> or grab some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/sets/72157603927131472/detail/">high-resolution images</a> to use as you see fit.
Because I only had some figures from November 2007 I was only able to do a comparison of the total registered users on Facebook but this will obviously be expanded somewhat next month. 
What I did find interesting (even with the limited data) was that the growth rate of registered users on Facebook only grew by 41,680 people in a three month period.
I have no official stats but I know from watching the trends in the past that registered users from SA had been growing at a phenomenal rate and this current figure tells me there is a major slow-down and possibly even a saturation in users. 
As a result we dropped from #9 to #10 in the world for registered users while Turkey and France nearly doubled their figures during this same period.
I hope that this information is of value to some of you and I'd love to hear some feedback, if possible.
