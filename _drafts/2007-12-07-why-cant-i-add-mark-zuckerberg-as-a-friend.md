I'm trying not be a troll but after reading Ray Hartley's <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/hartley/2007/12/06/facebook-apologises-over-privacy-invasion/">latest post</a> on Facebook I decided to see how many Facebook friends <a href="http://www.facebook.com/s.php?k=100000080&id=4">Mark Zuckerberg</a> has. Turns out he only has 554 friends but what I found more interesting was that you can't add Mark as a friend. 
What if I was his friend, how would I go about adding him?
