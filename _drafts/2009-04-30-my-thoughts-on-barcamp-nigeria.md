    like a doctor who has just diagnosed a patient of an ailment.\r\n\r\nTrue, there
    are lots of tech talents in Nigeria, but without a tech community, they can hardly
    get anywhere.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that BarCamp Nigeria and of course Startups Nigeria
    would help build that community we've been waiting for.\r\n\r\nCheers, Loy"

    Loy's and Possicon's summaries will give you the full picture!\r\n\r\n@Loy thanks
    for your cool comment. I really believe that what you're doing with Startups Nigeria
    is extremely valuable in helping to connect the community in ways that I don't
    think even you can understand. We have a couple of these sites here http://www.startupafrica.com
    & http://www.bandwidthblog.com are some of them helping connect Africa with African's
    and long may it continue.\r\n\r\nFrom speaking to delegates at BarCamp it seems
    that everyone is keen to make meetups more of a regular occurrence so I hope that
    this is the beginning of really good things to come! :)"

    you have diagnosed and see what the problems we face are. The opportunity provided

    of people at the event fired up to get something up. I believe before the end
    of the year, we will share a success story.\r\n\r\nLike you said, the community
    is really lacking in Nigeria. With the commitment from everyone side things will
    improve overtime.\r\n\r\nThank again Justin!"

  content: "Slight correction:\r\nIn slide 9, you stated that \"VC doesn't exist in
    SA\".\r\n\r\nI'm currently working at a tech-focused VC (under-the-radar start-up
    with plenty of funding) and I can tell you there are a number of capital providers
    looking for good investment ideas and good jockeys.\r\n\r\nThere's even an SA
    Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity association (www.savca.co.za) and if you
    look at the members list (http://tinyurl.com/savcalist) you'll notice number of
    VC entities playing in this space.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned Hasso Platner, who I believe
    specifically allocated EUR25m to ZA for a fund. They received +-100 business plans
    and were interested in about 5 IIRC at that time.\r\n\r\nInVenFin have been around
    for a while now. Cape Biotech focus on biotechnology, but do VC work.\r\n\r\nFor
    innovative projects, there's National Research Foundation funding, the DST's Innovation
    Fund, the DTI's SPII and various other government support projects.\r\n\r\nMark
    Shuttleworth's HBD runs a VC fund.\r\n\r\nThere are more, too, but I think my
    point is made."

  content: "Hi Andrew - thanks for your comment.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Slide 9 is
    that you're taking it out of context. Sure Venture Capital exists however it certainly
    doesn't exist if you're trying to start an online product.\r\n\r\nThat's my experience
    of it anyway. VC in this country is not focused online and I've spent countless
    hours with VC people in SA who simply aren't interested in online.\r\n\r\nIn addition,
    if your online product doesn't have a global strategy then you're simply wasting
    your time trying the VC route here.\r\n\r\nOne Angel investor I know was investing
    in SA/African focused online properties but has subsequently stopped. The bottom-line,
    there simply isn't a good enough return for VC to justify online startups in South
    Africa.\r\n\r\nI would certainly like to see how many of the VC firms above have
    invested in online startups here. I think we'd be hard pressed to find any.\r\n\r\nI'd
    like to be proven wrong but my experience tells me otherwise."

  content: "@Justin: Appreciate that it may be \"out of context\" but I was forwarded
    the link from someone else who had read and interpreted it the same way I did.
    This was why he suggested I take a look.\r\n\r\nSaying \"VC doesn't exist for
    online start-ups that only have SA market potential\" is also not true. I know
    directly of one and suspect I'd be able to find others by making a few calls.\r\n\r\nYou
    have however honed in on the problem: not offering sufficient returns.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can show an online start-up that can demonstrate sufficient return potential
    (70%-80% p.a. compounded on early stage start-ups, assuming you manage to achieve
    roughly 1 in 3 success rate), then one ought to be able to find money.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that there is not nearly as much money as there should be, nor is the attitude
    of most South Africans as risk-preferring as it should be and for these reasons
    I'll be making part of my mission communicating to people how best to develop
    and fund ideas in ZA, be it via VC's such as our fund or any other ways.\r\n\r\nI'd
    love for you to be able to attend the next BarCamp Nigeria and tell the guys that
    there are least 5 different people in ZA that are willing to fund innovative tech
    ideas, be they online or otherwise, and \"these are their key parameters\"."

    pitched to the various VC's in ZA?\r\n\r\nHow did you eliminate the possibilities
    that it was the idea or alternatively the management team presented to the VC's?\r\n\r\nI
    say this simply because if it were either of the above two possibilities, you
    could take a different idea and a different proposed team in and might have some
    success."

  content: "Hi Andrew\r\n\r\nYes I can see how the statement in the presentation was
    received and it's unfortunate at the same time. What I did say to the guys in
    Nigeria was that while traditional VC was difficult to come by there certainly
    is investment available but mostly through Media companies.\r\n\r\nWe're an example
    of that through the Naspers group, Blueworld another (also Naspers) and not to
    mention Zoopy through Vodacom.\r\n\r\nI also know a number of online startups
    who managed to get traditional VC but again not from SA but rather abroad. Bid
    or Buy is one off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Vinny Lingham, someone
    I know very well is probably the biggest success-story in terms of raising VC
    and while he managed to get the VC from a South African owned VC firm it is an
    exception to say the least.\r\n\r\nI think that in a way you and I are actually
    agreeing on the same thing. We both agree VC exists but SA VC for online startups
    is an exception not a norm due to the ROI for venture capitalists.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you compare the state of VC to say the US (not such a good thing to do) you can
    see that their market looks for opportunities that don't directly relate to revenue.
    In this market you have to show the compounded return and even then it's not an
    easy sell.\r\n\r\nWhen we were trying to raise money I spoke to a number of VC
    directly and even sat in a round-table discussion with some top VC firms with
    Vinny Lingham as well.\r\n\r\nEveryone agreed that unless we had a global strategy
    we wouldn't make it and I strongly disagreed with this logic. I am of the belief
    that Africa/SA is one of the most lucrative markets right now and will continue
    to grow yet this was a sentiment not shared by many.\r\n\r\nI think what Khalil
    had to say is very pertinent. Most South African's have no idea where to go to
    try and raise VC. It may exist but is not readily available and I have long been
    a pundit of trying to help change this.\r\n\r\nI've run 6 different startups all
    self-funded and I wish I had known where to go to.\r\n\r\nI'd love to sit down
    with you and chat more about this. It is something I feel passionate about and
    if we can promote this together I'd love for that to happen. In the end I want
    other entrepreneurs not to have to struggle to get their ideas into a highly competitive
    market."

<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/04/barcamp-nigeria-photo.jpg" alt="BarCamp Nigeria 2009" width="600" height="367" />
On Saturday I was fortunate enough to attend <a href="http://barcampnigeria.com/">BarCamp Nigeria 2009</a> in Lagos. Despite various concerns about going to Nigeria (more on that in another blog post) I must say I had a fantastic time and met some amazing people along the way.
Loy Okezie from Startups Nigeria has a really nice summary of the events that transpired <a href="http://www.startupsnigeria.com/2009/04/barcamp-nigeria-event-details-updates-photos-and-more/">over here</a> and there's another in depth look by Possicon <a href="http://webtrendsng.com/blog/barcamp-nigeria-has-come-and-gone%E2%80%A6-history-made-future-defined/">over here as well</a> so I won't rehash what's already been said.
What I will say is that this room, filled with about 80 Nigerians, was a true eye-opener for me. They all have university qualifications, all have an online startup (mostly ecommerce focused) and are all extremely well educated and experienced in the online space.
The big question in my mind has been that if a country like Nigeria is filled with such talented individuals in the largest Internet penetrated country in Africa (currently more than 10 million users) then why hasn't Nigeria produced any world-class Internet startups yet?
This seemed to be a general question and a reason why the event took place in the first place and while there were a lot of theories flying around such as poor connectivity, electricity problems, Government support and regulations, etc., I was left with a strong sense of what's been lacking - <strong>a community</strong>.
Up until BarCamp Nigeria most of these 80 people had never met in real-life before. Some have interacted online but for the most part each one has been left to his own devices and they're all trying to grow their businesses with very little help along the way.
This is the core difference to say South Africa where we do have a pretty strong online community and while it's often incestuous, contrived and filled with so-called <em>rockstars</em> this community does help drive products online. I can testify to this with my experiences with Afrigator - without the <em>community</em> we'd be nowhere.
South Africa's online community, or <em>early-adopters</em>, may well be small in the greater scheme of world markets but it all has to start somewhere and in Nigeria's case this hasn't really begun yet. I could see that after BarCamp the guys were hungry for more and so they should be. The more they meet, interact, share ideas and create partnerships along the way the more we'll see online innovation thriving out of Nigeria.
In addition to my observation I also had to do a presentation and to be honest I didn't really feel qualified to do so. I am the first to admit I don't know much about Nigeria so I decided to share my experiences of running an online startup in South Africa, shared some of our most detailed social media trends and finally launched our latest baby Gator - <a href="http://gatorpeeps.com">Gatorpeeps</a>.
Have a look at the presentation below and let me know what your thoughts are!
