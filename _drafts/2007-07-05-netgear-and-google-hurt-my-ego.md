I consider myself somewhat of a technical person and I pride myself by the fact that I'm able to problem-solve numerous issues when it comes to technology but I did find myself in a very tricky situation this morning. 
I was trying to show my wife the <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/?p=215">NYT video review of the iPhone</a> on <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/">Colin Daniels'</a> blog this morning only to find a big white block in place of the video player located on his page. I've watched this video there before so I figured there must be an issue with his blog.
I decided to find the original video on <a href="http://multimedia.thetimes.co.za/">The Times' Multimedia</a> site only to discover that the video player on this site was too rendering in a huge white block.
So, at 8:30 this morning I phoned Colin up to tell him his video player was messed and he better sort it out. The panic in his voice was evident and I can only imagine what was going through his mind while he drove into the office!
Needless to say I received a call at about 9:00 to tell me that the video player was perfect on his side and while on the phone I clicked exactly what the root cause was.
In an effort to combat porn and adult sites from being viewed by my nearly 4 year old son Luke, I decided to activate the child protection settings on my Netgear router. Part of this process is to add keywords that you want to block and the word <strong>anal</strong> was one of them.
When I checked the log file of my router I realised that the Multimedia site for The Times contains google-<strong>anal</strong>ytics code on the site and hence the video was being blocked from my side.
Imagine my embarrassment when I had to call Colin and tell him I was a twit...
