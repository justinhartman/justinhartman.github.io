My email to the News desk at SABC sent late Saturday evening - reply still pending.
<blockquote>Dear SABC News Team
I'd like to enquire as to why SABC News choses not to report on news in the English Premier League? I religiously watch the news on 3 and over the last few years I've noticed how you cover arbitrary sports such as boating, netball and more yet there is never a single mention of the English League.
I'm really not sure what LSM bracket you guys are targeting however you are the only media company in South Africa that simply ignores this highly popular sport.
Seeing as your CEO secured the rights to broadcast Monday night games in the English league one would expect a mention of the new season beginning in your latest broadcast this evening however there was none.
Surely there is a market for some, if not all, news coverage?
Regards
Justin Hartman
