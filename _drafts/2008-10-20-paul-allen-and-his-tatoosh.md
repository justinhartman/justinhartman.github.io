  content: Just saw the Tatoosh docked at the Riverwalk in New Orleans (Feb. 19, 2009).  It
    was the object of pictures for many tourist.  Everyone was amazed by the size
    and questioned who might own such a large yacht.  I went online as soon as I could
    to check out the yacht by name.  Wonder what it was doing in the Big Easy.

Yesterday the family and I shipped off to the V&A Waterfront to pay a visit to the <a href="http://www.aquarium.co.za/">Two Oceans Aquarium</a>. The aquarium in itself was awesome but after the expedition I noticed a yacht in the harbor which I simply had to go and see.
It turns out the magnificent yacht docked in Cape Town's harbor is none other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen">Paul Allen's</a> <em>smaller</em> yacht called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatoosh_(yacht)">Tatoosh</a>.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/2956111368/" title="Paul Allen's yacht - Tatoosh by Justin Hartman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3275/2956111368_9b98b9e8b5.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Paul Allen's yacht - Tatoosh" /></a>
For those who don't know the Microsoft co-founder's yacht has been here since October 15th and had I not seen the two helicopters parked on the deck (see pic below) then we might have missed this fantastic sight.
Paul Allen paid no less than $100 million for the 92m long Tatoosh and it features:-
<ul>
<li>Five decks</li>
<li>a master suite, a saloon and other rooms on the top deck</li>
<li>a saloon with a French limestone fireplace, a dining area, staterooms and a ladies' powder room on the main deck</li>
<li>a lobster tank</li>
<li>a shaded 1.8m deep swimming pool</li>
<li>a movie theater</li>
<li>facilities to transport two helicopters on the top two decks (see pic below)</li>
<li>a custom Hinckley powerboat about 12m</li>
<li>a Hinckley sailboat of about 12m</li>
</ul>

Paul also owns the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus_(yacht)">Octopus</a> which is the larger of his two yachts at 126m long. This makes the Octopus the second largest super yacht that is not owned by a head of state.
If you'd like to see all the pics I took of the Tatoosh (including a few shots of the great view of Table Mountain for all my Jo'burg friends) then <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/sets/72157608187959423/">click here for the full set on Flickr</a>.
