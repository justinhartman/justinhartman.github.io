To be honest I have to say that I can't believe it's only been a month since we <a href="/2008/10/16/moving-to-the-mother-city/">moved to Cape Town</a>. So much has happened this past month that I feel like an old pro navigating my way through the Mother City and living the <em>relaxed life</em>.
Well, not sure if that's all entirely true but we are all settling in very nicely which is hugely positive for me. I certainly feel like we've made the right decision coming here.
On the work front I'm amazed at how much we've managed to achieve in the last 30 days. For the first time ever <a href="http://stii.co.za">Stii</a> and I have been in the same place for longer than a couple drinks and having <a href="http://lesterhein.blogspot.com/">Lester</a> on board has been a blessing in disguise.
Lester has managed to turn the <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com">Afrigator Blog</a> into an entertaining read and people are actually enjoying it. His skills from a marketing and product perspective has been invaluable and he's really helping to humanise <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> in a way that I don't think we were able to do.
In total, Lester and I have done 24 meetings this past month, Stii lectured at <a href="http://gsbexecedblog.uct.ac.za/nomadicmarketing/">Nomadic Marketing</a> and I did a brief session at the <a href="http://gsbexecedblog.uct.ac.za/">Graduate School of Business</a> and we've meet some great people along the way. As a result we've established some really exciting partnerships and some of these are going to filter through in the next month.
Stii has been working very aggressively on rewriting Afrigator once again. We got to a point with Afrigator where we realised that a lot of what we plan to do in the coming months were not possible on our current framework so Stii's been living off coffee and beer ever since. We joke and say that Stii does the only real work in this company and in truth, without him I don't think we'd be as good as we are!
This month has been fantastic but the real reward has been seeing how a focused approach has really helped Afrigator gain some traction and growth. To give you an idea we increased our unique user base by 83% and our traffic to the site increased by 181% from September. We had a record breaking month which should make our shareholders happy.
I do realise that every month is probably not going to be as good as this past one but I feel extremely positive about our business and the direction it is going. While most of you can't yet see the fruits of our labour it will become visible very soon.
