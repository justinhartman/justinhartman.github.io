  content: I think this is a fair reflection of a general attitude of many people
    in this country, that of not caring and being completely apathetic about the law,
    people, and their surroundings.

The following picture was taken on Christmas Day on a street corner in Yeoville which is only about 1km away from where I live. You can't really see the message on the street pole (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=2174531245&size=l">larger image here</a>) but I can tell you that it says <strong>"NO DUMPING"</strong>.

What is it about the people of this country that encourages such an insult? Do we not care enough about our beautiful land or is this just limited to impoverished areas? I'm not sure I have the answer to any of this but I found it humourous and poetic at the same time.
