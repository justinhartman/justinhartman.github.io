Just launched this morning is a new <a href="http://afrigator.com/trends">Blog Trends</a> page on <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>. You can read more info about it <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2007/08/29/new-blog-trends-and-twitter-channel/">on the Afrigator blog site</a>.
Essentially the <a href="http://afrigator.com/trends">Blog Trends</a> page gives you a snapshot of the Afrosphere and goes into some detail on the amount of traffic we've sent through to our blog sites. The page also includes blog specific trends such as daily posts and traffic to these sites and I think it provides some valuable data for those who like pretty stats.
The best stat for me is the amount of click throughs we've sent to blog sites. We unfortunately only started tracking this data from June 16 this year but during this two and a half month period we've already sent 891,877 people to the blogosphere which works out to around 12,000 clicks a day or 368,000 a month.
On a side note we've also launched an <a href="http://twitter.com/Afrigator">Afrigator twitter channel</a> so twitter followers can keep up with hourly news from Afrigator.
Lots more to come...
