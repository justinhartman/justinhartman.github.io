I have a four year old. He loves music. The only problem is he loves listening to <em>his music</em> on my iPhone. The net result of this has been a complete dominance of kids music on my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/justinhartman">Last.fm profile</a>. I think the graph below illustrates my point.

Now prior to the new look Last.fm site there was no way to actually ban or remove artists from your profile. I asked other Last.fm connections if this could be done but alas, there was little hope of cleaning my profile up.
The great news is that all thanks to this...

...My Last.fm profile now looks like this:

Thank you Last.fm for giving me this much needed functionality!!!
