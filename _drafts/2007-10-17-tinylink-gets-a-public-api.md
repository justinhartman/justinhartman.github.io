    in the next 10 years - then we'll close it down for new urls and create a new
    TinyLink.

After a lengthy discussion with <a href="http://charlvn.za.net">Charl</a> last night I got some inspiration and created a <a href="http://tinylink.co.za/api/">Public API</a> for <a href="http://tinylink.co.za">TinyLink</a>. The API can be used through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> request and if you're a developer you can chose either to integrate into your application.
Charl has kindly created an example <a href="http://tinylink.co.za/api/python_example.php">Python script</a> and a PHP one will follow shortly.
I also spent some time and created an <a href="http://tinylink.co.za/about.php">About</a> page which highlights what the service is about as well as what's on the TODO list. 
Finally, I wanted to thank <a href="http://www.webadstudio.com/">Dominique</a> for doing the hard maths and working out that based on the current database structure TinyLink can hold a total of <strong>2,176,782,336</strong> urls. Calculators were needed!
I'm really not sure why but this project has got me very excited...
