  content: Justin, thanks for the heads up about the HTC Magic.  I have been using
    the HTC12C for 2 years now, and absolutely love it.  Glad to hear that it's Vodacom
    bringing the Magic to SA, as I've got my package thru them.

  content: "I'm waiting patiently for Vodacom to actually do something with the HTC
    Magic.  Various reports have said it would be out this week even though Vodacom's
    official press releases don't mention anything about when it's going to be released.\r\n\r\nOne
    major down side is that the Android market isn't yet available in SA.  I know
    you can use Handango or MobiHand to buy apps from, but there's a LOAD of apps
    that are only available on the Android Market.\r\n\r\nAt least the iPhone launched
    with the App Store in SA."

  content: "...meh... I think the only thing that could pry my iPhone from my cold
    dead hands is the Palm Pre especially with what I'm hearing about the iPhone firmware
    version 3"

Vodacom, if you're listening, I want to make it abundantly clear that I <strong>will not</strong>, under any circumstances, turn down an HTC Magic from you. Seriously though, since I found out <a href="http://txdaily.co.za/gadgets/google-g2-phone-south-africa/">Vodacom were bringing the HTC Magic to South Africa</a> I've been scampering around trying to get my hands on one.
I've been an iPhone owner since January 2008 and this is by far the longest I've ever kept a phone without feeling the need for a replacement. Over the last 16 months I've <a href="/?s=iphone">written extensively about my experiences</a> around being an iPhone user and rightly so - it's the single biggest mobile device to hit the world since say... the <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android OS</a>.
While I still love my iPhone it's time to part ways and the Android operating system has had me excited since it was announced. I doubt the Magic is really the iPhone killer but it's clear that Android devices are going to get better and smarter as the technology and OS evolve.
Yesterday evening I was listening to the latest ZA Tech Podcast, aptly titled <a href="http://zatech.co.za/episode-62/">Paranoid Android</a>, where <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/patternrecognition/">Toby Shapshak</a> takes us through some of the coolness that is the HTC Magic and now I'm even more convinced I need one seeing as my life literally revolves around Google Apps.
Thanks also to <a href="http://www.fmtech.co.za/">Duncan McLeod</a> who mentioned a really cool email client called <a href="http://www.postbox-inc.com/">Postbox</a> which I have duly installed and am now running on my Mac. Since I only use Google Apps for all my email I've found email clients (including Apple Mail) to be clunky and generally very slow with the Google IMAP servers however Postbox is not only fast but looks and functions great. Think of tabbed browsing for email and you'll get an idea as to what <a href="http://www.postbox-inc.com/features">Postbox can offer</a>.
On a very amusing sidenote Toby and <a href="http://www.simon.co.za/">Simon Dingle</a> claim that I made them swear during the podcast and you'll see what they mean at around 11:00 minutes in the show. These guys had me in stitches and I'm pleased that I cracked a cool mention on the show.
