Last night I decided to hook up the <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/devices/nokia-5530-xpressmusic">Nokia 5530 XpressMusic</a> which I received from Nokia. Unfortunately for me this phone is not supported on Apple Mac - <strong>at all</strong>!
When I say <em>at all</em> I mean <strong>at all</strong>. For example, Nokia Software Updater <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A41457135?qt=mac&comp=5530%20XpressMusic&cat=support&fullcontent=true&cnt=1&page=1">isn't compatible</a>, Nokia PC Suite <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A41457135?qt=mac&comp=5530%20XpressMusic&cat=support&fullcontent=true&cnt=1&page=2">isn't compatible</a>, there is only <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A41457135?qt=mac&comp=5530%20XpressMusic&cat=support&fullcontent=true&cnt=1&page=3">limited Mac compatibility</a> (i.e. GPRS & Bluetooth), <a href="http://www.comeswithmusic.com/">Nokia Music</a> isn't supported so you can't download songs to your Mac and finally, there is <strong>no</strong> iSync plugin for the 5530 XpressMusic either.
While I respect that Nokia are still in development with their Mac version of the Nokia Music app I am perplexed that there is no plugin for iSync. With no other access to Nokia applications, using iSync is the only way you can get contacts and calendar items to the phone and without the plugin the phone is pretty much useless.
I didn't like this ofcourse so I've created a 5530 XpressMusic iSync plugin that any Mac user with this phone can happily download. Here's what you need to do:
<ul>
<li><a href="/assets/images/uploads/2009/09/Nokia_5530_XpressMusic_isync_plugin_2v0.phoneplugin.zip">Download the 5530 XpressMusic iSync plugin here</a></li>
<li>Double-click the downloaded ZIP file and it will expand and leave you with a file called <strong>Nokia_5530_XpressMusic_isync_plugin_2v0.phoneplugin</strong></li>
<li>Now you need to move this file to the following location on your Mac: <strong>/Library/PhonePlugins/</strong>. You may need to create the PhonePlugins folder because mine didn't exist when I did this.</li>
<li>When you're done, open up iSync and click on Add Device - it should pick up your 5530 and you can then double-click it to add it to iSync.</li>
</ul>
When this is all done, you should see the following screenshot and voila - you can now sync contacts and calendars with the Nokia 5530 XpressMusic on your Mac.
