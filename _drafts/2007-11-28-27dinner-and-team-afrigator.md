Lots has been written about the eventful <a href="http://27dinner.pbwiki.com">27dinner</a> last night but I just wanted to say that it was an awesome experience all round. I did a presentation in which I announced the launch of the private beta version of <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> and more details, along with the presentation, can be found on the <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2007/11/28/private-beta-launched/">official blog</a>.
<a href="http://nicharalambous.com">Nic</a> also recorded the entire presentation and I'm trying desperately to get it uploaded so hopefully more details will follow soon.
The highlight for me was having all four Afrigators in the same room at the same time. It took eight months but finally Team Afrigator was a unit - if only for a few short hours.
