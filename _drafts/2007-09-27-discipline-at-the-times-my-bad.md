I've been reprimanded by my superior, <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/">Colin Daniels</a>. This email just arrived moments ago.

JJ,
I've had reports from an anonymous source in the newsroom who is concerned about your work output.
Apparently this is all you've done so far this morning:
9:25: got into office
9:26: touched Gregor's leg
9:35: got coffee
9:36: gone smoking
10:00: on phone with Colin
10:08: got coffee, forced Gregor to go with
10:09: had another smoke
10:11: watched Vincent on Sky news
10:20: surfed www.powergenitalia.com
10:21: made Gregor translate some german porn email
10:21: phone plummer...
Now obviously this is NOT what you are employed to do. I would appreciate a bit more respect and really don't want to have to lodge a formal complaint with HR!
I am always available to discuss this issue further if you feel that it is undue condemnation.
