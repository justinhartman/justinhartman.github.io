  content: Are we completely locked out or are there just restrictions on certain
    albums? We use emusic and it mostly works but occasionally it throws up an error
    that the album is not available in SA. Our thought are that when there is an SA
    distributor the album can't be sold from the US. As emusic is mostly indie it
    doesn't apply, most of the time. So I guess just being locked out of certain mainstream
    albums would in effect be the same as being locked out of the whole of amazon
    mp3. Sorry, did I just answer my own question?

  content: "The music industry has byzantine licensing deals that are different for
    every country.  Obtaining the rights to sell just one album in a certain country
    can involve several parties, including the issuing label, the music label, and
    the artist's representation.  This is why iTunes only operates in twenty countries.
    \ For each country, they have determine whether the mountain of legal work with
    hundreds of parties over months, will be justified by the revenue they'll receive
    from selling songs at 99 cents each.  For lots of countries the figures just don't
    work sadly.  Not iTunes or Amazon's fault - it's the messed up music industry.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to see this action, just try and legally license a few songs for use
    at an event.  In SA this will involve negotiating with one body for the label
    rights, directly with the music publishers of each song, which don't have any
    single body representing them, and acquiring a mechanical recording  license to
    legally burn all these songs to one CD for the event.  These negotiations will
    typically take several months.  Result:  no one bothers, because it's just too
    complex (and because your chance of getting sued is also zero due to the immense
    complexities involved).  People play music at all sorts of public events, and
    don't pay a dime, because the music industry has made it all but impossible to
    legally license the music.  Therefore they make zero money from this.  Talk about
    dinosaurs facing extinction.\r\n\r\nPS.  If you delve deeper you will find that
    a surprising amount (they refuse to disclose the percentage) of eMusic's catalogue
    is also not available to be downloaded by anyone paying with a South African credit
    card.  These titles don't appear in their listings for SA users."

  content: Neil thanks for clarifying that for us all. I guess that with only 3.5million
    Internet users in SA it's not likely we'll see iTunes soon but I'd imagine that
    Amazon would come to the party sooner rather than later.

When I read of the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/09/amazoncom-launc.html">launch</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=163856011">Amazon MP3</a> I honestly thought that finally some large company was seriously going to change accessibility to music in South Africa. How wrong I was...
While Amazon MP3 will compete directly, and very effectively, with iTunes it really hasn't changed much for us third-world users here in South Africa. Jason Bagley <a href="http://www.jasonbagley.com/2007/09/27/waiting-for-itunes-to-come-to-sa-dont-use-amazon-mp3/">reports</a> that Amazon MP3 works well for him but I've now tried to buy three different albums and all three gave me the following error message.  
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/10/amazonmp33.png' alt='Amazon MP3 Error Message' />
Here I was getting all excited but clearly there are still a lot of usage restrictions for us mere mortals...
