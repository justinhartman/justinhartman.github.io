    though - do you really think (besides the free range setup) that it is any different
    on any other chicken farm that has to turn over a high volume of meat on a tight
    deadline? Why don't we all just become vegetarians then? Do you agree with fish
    being bred (essentially) in dams full of steroids to meet the large chain stores
    in this country's demand for fresh fish? Do you approve of how cattle, sheep or
    pigs are raised and slaughtered for the benefit of your Sunday lunch or that weekend
    braai you look forward to all week?\r\n\r\nAs I say - nothing justifies cruelty
    to animals, but you can't blame just one company - regulate the industry better."

  content: "Jayx, I couldn't agree more with you. While Marc and I were joking about
    in comments I think his point was very similar - we can't just blame KFC.\r\n\r\nThe
    only way to prevent this and other situations like it from happening is to become
    a vegan and not eat any animals. That said, it's simply not practical for most
    and meat is a basic human need which in KFC's case drives them to kill 850 million
    chickens each year.\r\n\r\nMy uncle used to own a chicken farm in Windhoek and
    I had the pleasure of spending a couple weeks there in my teenage years. Watching
    how those chickens lived and seeing how they slaughter pigs really made me ill
    to my stomach.\r\n\r\nWhile we can't tackle the world all at once I think we should
    start somewhere and boycotting KFC and Mc Donalds (who have also had their share
    of bad publicity) are a good start to fighting the problem. Besides - neither
    of them are any good for your body anyway.\r\n\r\nMy issue with KFC and the reason
    for the post was simply to inform others of what is going on. I only heard about
    it over the weekend and read and watched the video online last night so clearly
    there is a need to spread this.\r\n\r\nWhile there is little we can do to ensure
    basic decency in the slaughtering of these chickens (and other animals) I am very
    very very disgusted at KFC's stance. It's one thing to partake in this, it's a
    completely different thing to continuously ignore the pleas of millions of people."

  content: "I hadn't eaten KFC for many years, since I was a teenager I think, and
    when my sons and I had to spend a night in a strange town at a hotel because our
    flight left at an ungodly morning hour, we got hungry and went in search of a
    real meal, not vending machine crap.\r\nThere was a Walmart and a KFC in this
    podunk town, that was it.\r\nSo we bought a bucket and walked the 5 minutes back
    to the hotel room.\r\n\r\nI looked in the bucket and it looked disgusting. I smelled
    it, it smelled like fish. I took one bite, and it also tasted like fish.\r\nMy
    sons couldn't eat it either after only a few bites, so we dumped it in the hallway
    dumpster so as not to stink up our room.\r\nThe next morning all 3 of us threw
    up. \r\nClearly rotten chicken.\r\nAt least we each only tossed that one time,
    we had an 8 hour flight ahead of us. \r\n\r\nThat was a year ago, and I haven't
    eaten their food again, and never will.\r\nAnd now because of this post and information,
    it makes my resolve to never eat it again even stronger. \r\n\r\nBut if you ever
    want to see a good film about the beef industry, watch Fast Food Nation. The meat
    packing plant scenes were extremely hard to watch, and my consumption of beef
    has gone down drastically since."

    so we as consumers need to continue making noise. I agree with Garsen, we do turn
    a blind eye when it suits us, but we really don't have to. We can choose not to
    support a company that condones animal cruelty.\r\n\r\nWe CAN make a difference
    if we keep up with the protests - KFC Canada is independent of the rest of the
    operations that do still endorse the cruelty exercised by it's suppliers.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I don't like the stuff (just like Kat, I think it stinks and tastes terrible),
    but my kids eat it and guess who pays for that? Well, no more!"

    They are also supposed to be cooked alive. Years ago a vet told me that he would
    not eat chicken meat as the chickens in the pens are given medicines repeatedly,
    day after day, when the one course is finished the next one is added to the water.
    So much for everybody eating eggs that are laid by hens that are given artificial
    light to simulate two days in one, so they lay twice in a 24 hour cycle. Ever
    wondered why the average egg's yolk is yellow instead of orange like the free
    range eggs? These hens are also kept under in\"humane\" conditions. This is in
    SA and has been so for as long as I can remember. \r\n\r\nI have turned mainly
    vegetarian years ago with only the occasional meat (including chicken for those
    who think chicken is not classified as meat) meal. Maybe more should consider
    this to save our planet and ourselves."

    because you so willingly jumped onto PETA's bandwagon without checking to see
    what KFC has to say about it or whether there are other articles about this matter
    that are relevant.\r\n\r\nWhile it is your blog and you are perfectably permitted
    to post whatever you like (barring any objections and hinderances to Free Speech
    by the HRC), I have to wonder why you did not pause for a moment to wonder if
    PETA's allegations were false or did not apply to us here in South Africa.\r\n\r\nI
    have to wonder why you would shortcut all the reasoning and processing that intelligent
    writers submit themselves to, usually. I think emotion probably dictated to you.
    I understand how that can happen. I've written a few emotionally fueled blog posts
    myself.\r\n\r\nI think it's fair to say, though, that in future anyone would be
    well advised to double check anything coming from PETA, because that organisation

  content: "Richard, I am not from SA, I am from the US. I actually had no idea you
    were all in SA until I started reading the comments, but anyway...\r\n\r\nI am
    not a fan of the American based PETA organization because of some of their methods
    to get the word out on animal cruelty. \r\nI think that finding out where wealthy
    women who may be wearing a fur coat will be, then showing up, and then either
    throwing blood all over the woman and coat, throwing buckets of cream on them
    or a bucket of paint, is not the way to go about spreading their message. \r\nWhile
    wearing a fur coat is cruelty to animals, doing any of the things mentioned above
    is cruel to their fellow human beings. They place the lives of every animal above
    the lives of people.\r\nThey have even done some things that could have seriously
    injured the person they were after for wearing fur, like throwing a bucket of
    bleach on a woman once, could have very easily blinded the woman and scalded her
    face and throat permanently.\r\n\r\nBut the fact remains that chicken farms, heck,
    any farm/plant that raises an animal for consumption, takes drastic measures to
    insure the animal is large so it can produce a lot of meat but be in terrible
    health, and they all do process these animals for our consumption in ways which
    are very cruel and extremely tragic. \r\n\r\nBut it also remains that we people
    continue to eat meat, all kinds of meat, chicken, beef, pork, deer, moose, fish,
    and shellfish. \r\nThe only way to stop all of these cruel animal deaths, is to
    somehow get every single human being the entire world over, to stop eating all
    forms of meat at the same time and refuse to ever eat it again. \r\n\r\nThat will
    never happen.\r\nAnd know how I know? \r\nBecause even knowing what the disease
    mad cow can do in humans, people still eat it the world over.\r\nBird flu? We
    still eat poultry?\r\nRed tide? Oil spills? We still consume large quantities
    of sea life.\r\n\r\nWe may be able to take out one or two eateries like KFC by
    refusing to buy their brand, but we still have Chick fil-A, and a whole slew of
    other poultry specialized eateries to take their place."

    though - do you really think (besides the free range setup) that it is any different
    on any other chicken farm that has to turn over a high volume of meat on a tight
    deadline? Why don&#39;t we all just become vegetarians then? Do you agree with
    fish being bred (essentially) in dams full of steroids to meet the large chain
    stores in this country&#39;s demand for fresh fish? Do you approve of how cattle,
    sheep or pigs are raised and slaughtered for the benefit of your Sunday lunch
    or that weekend braai you look forward to all week?<br><br>As I say - nothing
    justifies cruelty to animals, but you can&#39;t blame just one company - regulate
    the industry better.

  content: Jayx, I couldn&#39;t agree more with you. While Marc and I were joking
    about in comments I think his point was very similar - we can&#39;t just blame
    KFC.<br><br>The only way to prevent this and other situations like it from happening
    is to become a vegan and not eat any animals. That said, it&#39;s simply not practical
    for most and meat is a basic human need which in KFC&#39;s case drives them to
    kill 850 million chickens each year.<br><br>My uncle used to own a chicken farm
    in Windhoek and I had the pleasure of spending a couple weeks there in my teenage
    years. Watching how those chickens lived and seeing how they slaughter pigs really
    made me ill to my stomach.<br><br>While we can&#39;t tackle the world all at once
    I think we should start somewhere and boycotting KFC and Mc Donalds (who have
    also had their share of bad publicity) are a good start to fighting the problem.
    Besides - neither of them are any good for your body anyway.<br><br>My issue with
    KFC and the reason for the post was simply to inform others of what is going on.
    I only heard about it over the weekend and read and watched the video online last
    night so clearly there is a need to spread this.<br><br>While there is little
    we can do to ensure basic decency in the slaughtering of these chickens (and other
    animals) I am very very very disgusted at KFC&#39;s stance. It&#39;s one thing
    to partake in this, it&#39;s a completely different thing to continuously ignore
    the pleas of millions of people.

  content: I hadn&#39;t eaten KFC for many years, since I was a teenager I think,
    and when my sons and I had to spend a night in a strange town at a hotel because
    our flight left at an ungodly morning hour, we got hungry and went in search of
    a real meal, not vending machine crap.<br>There was a Walmart and a KFC in this
    podunk town, that was it.<br>So we bought a bucket and walked the 5 minutes back
    to the hotel room.<br><br>I looked in the bucket and it looked disgusting. I smelled
    it, it smelled like fish. I took one bite, and it also tasted like fish.<br>My
    sons couldn&#39;t eat it either after only a few bites, so we dumped it in the
    hallway dumpster so as not to stink up our room.<br>The next morning all 3 of
    us threw up. <br>Clearly rotten chicken.<br>At least we each only tossed that
    one time, we had an 8 hour flight ahead of us. <br><br>That was a year ago, and
    I haven&#39;t eaten their food again, and never will.<br>And now because of this
    post and information, it makes my resolve to never eat it again even stronger.
    <br><br>But if you ever want to see a good film about the beef industry, watch
    Fast Food Nation. The meat packing plant scenes were extremely hard to watch,
    and my consumption of beef has gone down drastically since.

    ? Any of you eat crayfish? They are also supposed to be cooked alive. Years ago
    a vet told me that he would not eat chicken meat as the chickens in the pens are
    given medicines repeatedly, day after day, when the one course is finished the
    next one is added to the water. So much for everybody eating eggs that are laid
    by hens that are given artificial light to simulate two days in one, so they lay
    twice in a 24 hour cycle. Ever wondered why the average egg&#39;s yolk is yellow
    instead of orange like the free range eggs? These hens are also kept under in"humane"
    conditions. This is in SA and has been so for as long as I can remember. <br><br>I
    have turned mainly vegetarian years ago with only the occasional meat (including
    chicken for those who think chicken is not classified as meat) meal. Maybe more
    should consider this to save our planet and ourselves.

    that intelligent writers submit themselves to, usually. I think emotion probably

  content: Richard, I am not from SA, I am from the US. I actually had no idea you
    were all in SA until I started reading the comments, but anyway...<br><br>I am
    not a fan of the American based PETA organization because of some of their methods
    to get the word out on animal cruelty. <br>I think that finding out where wealthy
    women who may be wearing a fur coat will be, then showing up, and then either
    throwing blood all over the woman and coat, throwing buckets of cream on them
    or a bucket of paint, is not the way to go about spreading their message. <br>While
    wearing a fur coat is cruelty to animals, doing any of the things mentioned above
    is cruel to their fellow human beings. They place the lives of every animal above
    the lives of people.<br>They have even done some things that could have seriously
    injured the person they were after for wearing fur, like throwing a bucket of
    bleach on a woman once, could have very easily blinded the woman and scalded her
    face and throat permanently.<br><br>But the fact remains that chicken farms, heck,
    any farm/plant that raises an animal for consumption, takes drastic measures to
    insure the animal is large so it can produce a lot of meat but be in terrible
    health, and they all do process these animals for our consumption in ways which
    are very cruel and extremely tragic. <br><br>But it also remains that we people
    continue to eat meat, all kinds of meat, chicken, beef, pork, deer, moose, fish,
    and shellfish. <br>The only way to stop all of these cruel animal deaths, is to
    somehow get every single human being the entire world over, to stop eating all
    forms of meat at the same time and refuse to ever eat it again. <br><br>That will
    never happen.<br>And know how I know? <br>Because even knowing what the disease
    mad cow can do in humans, people still eat it the world over.<br>Bird flu? We
    still eat poultry?<br>Red tide? Oil spills? We still consume large quantities
    of sea life.<br><br>We may be able to take out one or two eateries like KFC by
    refusing to buy their brand, but we still have Chick fil-A, and a whole slew of
    other poultry specialized eateries to take their place.

    inflicted on these animals. The place you got your info from is just one place
    thats the thing and to many they think PETA(the people who sell this bs) are well
    bsing their info. and i can not say weather it is true or now but i do beilive
    we have to investigate before we just decide on something

    cruelty at KFC. Yum! brand foods, KFC, Tyson Chicken and other companies involved
    need to get it through their head that not only is this treatment of animals imoral,
    but also unhealthy.\r\n\r\nPlus the chicken there tastes icky anyway from what
    I recall."

  content: "I'm vegetarian for animal rights reasons but even if I wasn't, you'd never
    catch me eating s*** like KFC. \r\n\r\nFirstly because I wouldn't want to eat
    the meat of something that spent its life staggering around in its own excrement.
    Hens don't do this when they aren't forced to.\r\n\r\nSecondly because when you
    eat a chicken that's been pumped full of hormones (to make it bigger)and antibiotics
    (to keep it healthy while it wades through s***), that's what goes into your system.
    You could be damaging yourself.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I'm reliably informed by my meat-eating
    family that 'happy' chickens are tasty chickens. They don't need hormones and
    water injections to get bigger; they just run around outside and build up their
    muscles naturally."

Over the weekend I learned about how <a href="http://www.kfc.com">KFC</a> suppliers overpopulate birds in their factories, drug them and boil them alive to remove their feathers. I honestly couldn't believe what I was hearing so I did some further investigation.
It turns out that <a href="http://www.peta.org/about/index.asp">PETA</a>, an animal rights organisation, along with PETA activist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_anderson">Pamela Anderson</a> have formed the <a href="http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/">Kentucky Fried Cruelty</a> campaign to help spread the word.
While this is not a new campaign I found the following statement on the <a href="http://www.kentuckyfriedcruelty.com/">Kentucky Fried Cruelty</a> website truly shocking:
<blockquote>KFC&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own animal welfare advisors have asked the company to take steps to eliminate these abuses, but KFC refuses to do so.
</blockquote>
I watched the video below and I'm not sure how I, or anyone who watches this, can ever eat KFC again.
