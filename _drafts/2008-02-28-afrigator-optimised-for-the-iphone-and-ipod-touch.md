We <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2008/02/28/iphone-ipod-touch-mobile-site-launched/">announced on the Afrigator blog</a> last night that our site is now optimised for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch">iPod Touch</a>.
This is something I've wanted to do for some time now and once we had the standard <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2008/02/03/afrigator-mobile-next-version-launched/">mobile site completed</a>, integration for the iPhone version was simple.
I think this makes us the first website in Africa to launch an optimised version for Apple's highly successful devices but I stand to be corrected.
It is unclear how successful the penetration is of the iPhone and iPod Touch in Africa but it's going to be interesting to see what sort of uptake we have on this new platform. 
Here are some screenshots of the interface and you can view a whole bunch more <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/sets/72157603996809150/">over here</a>.
