<img align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/08/davidbullard.jpg' alt='David Bullard' /><a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/bullard/">David Bullard</a>, <em>acclaimed</em> journalist and public enemy number one, recently invited me to an extended lunch with some other elite bloggers - <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/">youngBLOOD</a> and <a href="http://www.groogle.co.za">Groogle</a>. It was inevitable really that our paths would cross and I have to say I feel most privileged that I have had the opportunity to meet the man in person.
After calling David a <a href="/2007/05/07/is-david-bullard-an-utter-wanker/">wanker</a> one would imagine the man would never want to talk to me again however he has been a true gentleman about the <a href="http://vincentmaher.com/mit/?p=347">Bullardgate</a> affair and in particular my reaction to the whole event.
I have to admit that I really enjoyed my lunch at <a href="http://www.thegrillhouse.co.za/">The Grill House</a> with Bullard and I noticed this morning that he <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/bullard/?p=106">sneakily took a snap</a> of me on his new Nokia phone which he's now trying to sell on eBay.
David, you do realise this picture of me is better suited for <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/">Sotheby's</a>? I am after-all a highly sought after individual.
