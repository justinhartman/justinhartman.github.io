  content: "Very nice. The Afrigator growth is a phenominal success. It is also encouraging
    to see the big uptake in blogs, but disheartening to see it decline. However,
    the accrued growth does seem to average on the up. Do you think Gatorpeeps played
    a part in this at the time of the big vertical of March this year?\r\n\r\nThe
    two mobile channels is certainly excellent news for iPhone and HTC users, but
    what about us BlackBerry champions?\r\n\r\nI would have loved to hear a bot more
    about the T-Shirts ;)"

  content: Nice prez. Amazing growth.  Think Africa has a lot of actualising to do
    in the online sense, which should assure growth for you for some time to come.  Love
    your recipe for success formula, and also when to seek investment [after gaining
    traction based on your own investments].  If you don't back yourself, why should
    anyone else...  Thanks for sharing with us.

  content: "Emil, the March blog growth was as a direct result of our integration
    with 24.com Blogs (now Letterdash). So while it looks like it declined in April,
    May this isn't really accurate. The average seems to be around 700-800 new blogs
    a month now.\r\n\r\nBlackberry will be next on the list. One of us just needs
    to get our hands on one so we can dev and test ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat more can be said
    about T's man. You have to have em, and give em away to have a successful startup!!!
    :-D"

  content: "@Nic and @Robert, thanks for the comments guys!\r\n\r\n@Tim, as I said
    this morning, the truth is we never really planned things according to the presso.
    We didn't really know what we were doing but we certainly have a better take on
    things now. So while lack of planning will get you somewhere at some point you
    need to actually work it all out - properly!\r\n\r\n@Jacques - was great to finally
    meet you and put a face to the name I've been seeing on Twitter. Glad you enjoyed
    it and looking forward to meeting up with you again in the near future - I hope!"

  content: "Thanks for coming clean - the bill's in the post.\r\n\r\nNo, just kidding,
    but glad you found a use for it. \r\n\r\nGood pres Justin, particularly like the
    way you show the application of theory and really good to see Afrigator's growth
    has been better than expected [assuming expected = budgeted :) ]. Keep going and
    growing!"

This morning I delivered the following presentation to the students of Stellenbosch University's Media Lab. My topic was on the start-up lifecycle and I think it went alright. Students are sometimes hard to gauge but I hope that this provided some insight into life running a startup. There's also some interesting insight into the Afrigator business which has never been released.
Special thanks to Darren Gorton for <em>unknowingly</em> allowing me to use his <a href="http://outthink.co.za/index.php/2009/07/the-lighter-side-of-startups/">lighter side of startups presentation</a> in mine! I simply love it! He's also got a great post on <a href="http://outthink.co.za/index.php/2009/07/funding-for-startups-and-new-ventures-in-south-africa/">funding for startups in South Africa</a> which any entrepreneur must read.
