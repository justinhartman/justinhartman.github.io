  content: My personal advertisers get better ad spots than the adgator/addynamo ads.
    Only reason they don't perform as well.

  content: I was very interested to see that the CPM model is quite high in your book.  I
    have found that CPC is much more manageable and shows a guaranteed ROI as opposed
    to CPM which is almost like a crap in the ocean.

  content: "Justin the thing is that it actually doesn't matter what you're using
    - they all equate to the same thing.\r\n\r\nA CPC for example can always be equated
    to an eCPM and vice versa. Yes CPM is generally more expensive however some brands
    prefer owning a space and dominating it with their ads and CPM works well for
    this.\r\n\r\nIt really boils down to what your end-goal is and what your expectations
    are. Google figured CPC was the business but in later years have introduced CPM
    because some advertisers simply prefer that model."
