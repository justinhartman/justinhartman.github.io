This is so unintentional but as of this morning three new sites I'm involved in went live.
<strong>Afrigator Mobile</strong>
<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2381/2237924048_84e37efc02_o.png" alt="Afrigator Mobile" />
This is the second <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> mobile site to go live. After we launched the second version of Afrigator we lost the functionality with version one of the mobile site but over the weekend I finalised things and our mobile application is now working. 
When Scott posted <a href="http://www.scott.za.net/with-less-power-comes-more-responsibility_2008-01-22/">this blog post</a> I decided it was time to sort things out and we too tested a number of redirect scripts. Ultimately I found that PHP worked best for this and now if you go to afrigator.com on your mobile it will automatically take you to the afrigator.mobi site. Likewise if you're on a desktop browser and visit afrigator.mobi you'll be taken directly to the .com version so we are optimising the site depending on what browser your accessing the site from.
You can read more about the new mobile site <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2008/02/03/afrigator-mobile-next-version-launched/">here</a>.
<strong>MyWebShots</strong>
<a href="http://www.mywebshots.co.za"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2285/2241869852_2c185bab22.jpg" alt="MyWebShots.co.za" /></a>
I've been working with Dominique from <a href="http://codecentral.co.za/">Code Central</a> for some time, in fact ever since he launched MyWebShots. We did some initial integration with his service and Afrigator and we've been using the service ever since to generate thumbnails on the Afrigator website.
In a random set of events Dominique has kindly handed over MyWebShots for me to take control. He's got some other commitments which is limiting his time on this particular project and since we already use the service so much I guess he figured the code would be best looked after in my hands. I am so greatful to Dominique for this and thanks to 12-months free hosting from <a href="http://www.afrihost.com">Afrihost</a>, <a href="http://www.mywebshots.co.za">MyWebShots</a> has just gone live.
The service will remain as is and Dominique and I will worry about migrating existing clients to the new domain. I'm of the opinion that the service and brand are very strong as a stand alone application and for this reason MyWebShots will remain in tact. What this does do is allow Afrigator to white-label the service and customise it to our needs. Very exciting times.

And finally a new gadget review site that I've started with <a href="http://nicharalambous.com">Nic</a> and <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a> has officially gone live. We figured that there really isn't a definitive gadget review site in this country and with Nudjit we hope to change this. Ironically we've already received some great reviews from both <a href="http://www.bandwidthblog.com/2008/02/04/local-blogging-celebs-launch-gadget-blog-nudjit/">Charl Norman</a> and <a href="http://chilibean.co.za/2008/02/04/nudjit-new-gadget-blog-on-the-block/">Paul Jacobson</a>.
