  content: I've always thought people make much too big a deal of this. During that
    same period Microsoft invested $200M in Best Buy, a larger investment than in
    Apple. And it certainly wasn't to save Best Buy as it wasn't in Apple's case either.
    $150M is pretty paltry in the scheme of things.

  content: "This little bit of FUD has been shovelled out to the masses for over a
    decade, how Microsoft saved Apple. PURE BULL SHIT! At the time Apple had billions
    in the bank and Microsoft saved nothing but it's on ass.\r\n\r\nAt this time Apple
    had about three dozen slam dunk lawsuits against Microsoft, that Microsoft was
    going to lose, which would further illustrate they were an illegal monopolist.
    Microsoft desperately needed to settle and Apple couldn't afford a long lawsuit
    so they settled for several billions in cash paid by Microsoft over the next few
    years. The settlement gave Apple free use of any previous Microsoft patents and
    any they would gain over the following five years. Apple also could charge any
    rate they wanted for any Apple patented stuff already stolen by Microsoft or to
    be stolen in future. Also Microsoft would have no rights to sue as would Apple
    for specified infringements. Apple also gained complete access to all Microsoft
    APIs and documentation at NO cost. No real value as demonstrated by their licensing
    of same APIs has been a complete failure.\r\n\r\nThe Five years of office development
    and $150,000 no voting stock was also an 'Apple condition of settlement' to show
    Microsoft's faith in Apple's survival since all the morons were forecasting Apple's
    demise. The non-voting stock Microsoft was forced to buy was ALL sold the first
    day it was eligible for sale, three years later and Microsoft quadrupled their
    money, something that can't be said for Microsoft shares.\r\n\r\nThis FUD, 'Microsoft
    saved Apple', has been floated out by Microsoft apologists for a decade. Microsoft's
    stock is flat-lined and every area where Microsoft has to compete, they fail,
    continually losing tens of billions per year trying to use their illegal thuggery
    to eliminate legitimate competitors. This IS the definition of an illegal monopolist
    and is why they keep losing their antitrust battles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Apple stock
    continues to skyrocket up fifteen fold in just the past few years while Microsoft
    has no new ideas, never has had, and continues to extort outrageous sums from
    the stupid with equal lack of vision. Microsoft has been dead for the better part
    of a decade and it will take a long time for the stench to go away especially
    if the stupid continue to shovel cash at their abysmal software."

  content: Apple was NOT on the verge of collapse.  At the time of the Microsoft $150
    million investment, Apple had nearly $4 billion in cash and very little debt on
    it's balance sheet.  The important part of the agreement was that Microsoft would
    continue development of Office for the Mac.  Apple agreed to drop any outstanding
    litigation regarding the Windows interface.  The $150 mil investment was a good
    faith gesture at best and did not save Apple as has been widely misreported.

  content: "It seems Mr. Hartman's shoddy journalism skills are not limited to just
    getting the facts dead wrong - he also can't spell right.\r\n\r\n(but thanx nonetheless
    to the two posters who point out the healthy state of apple's balance sheet at
    the time as well as the undisclosed patent settlement microsoft paid to apple
    - which was at least an order of magnitude greater (ie 10X) than the publicly
    disclosed &amp; trifling small equity investment of $150M, as one can infer from
    analyzing the P/L income statements of the period).\r\n\r\nIn mr. hartman's own
    profile on this web site he writes that he is expecting the \"arrive\" of a new
    son - whereas what he meant to write is \"arrival\".\r\n\r\nA man who can't even
    be bothered to proofread the basic facts about his son's existence is not likely
    to be a journalist capable of simple fact-checking!\r\n\r\nPerhaps \"new media\"
    strategists should be required to demonstrate some proficiency with \"old media\"
    before they are allowed to start hawking their wares?"

    after the issue people still feel passionate about this.\r\n\r\nThank to you to
    the people who helped clarify the facts, I have amended the original article where
    necessary. I have to admit finding the facts on this topic was not as easy as
    one would imagine. Seems that while the actual event is pretty well documented,
    what happened to the shares and what that meant to each company is not really
    public knowledge.\r\n\r\n@zahadum: Just to clarify - I am not a journalist. I
    may work for a newspaper but I'm involved in the social media side for the company.
    Maybe this is not clear but I'm not claiming to be a journalist and this blog
    is merely a perspective of my day-to-day experiences. While this topic may be
    10 years old this post was spurred on because of a meeting I had with one of the
    Apple executives who gave me this original information.\r\n\r\nPS. Thanks for
    pointing out the grammar mistake - it has been rectified."

  content: I remember that time well. Several months prior to the Microsoft investment
    in Apple and the appearance of Bill Gates on the big screen behind Steve Jobs,
    I bought 2,000 shares of Apple for $12 a share. They had about $13 per share in
    cash! Talk about a bargain. With two splits since then, that 2,000 shares is now
    8,000 shares at a cost of $3 per share. Why did I buy then? It was an investment
    in Steve Jobs. He had just taken the helm at Apple and I had utmost faith in this
    guy. Still do. Guys with his vision and commitment to perfection are extremely
    rare in business. He is up there with Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and John Rockerfeller.
    History will show this to be true.

  content: I remember that time well. Several months prior to the Microsoft investment
    in Apple and the appearance of Bill Gates on the big screen behind Steve Jobs,
    I bought 2,000 shares of Apple for $12 a share. They had about $13 per share in
    cash! Talk about a bargain. With two splits since then, that 2,000 shares is now
    8,000 shares at a cost of $3 per share. Why did I buy then? It was an investment
    in Steve Jobs. He had just taken the helm at Apple and I had utmost faith in this
    guy. Still do. Guys with his vision and commitment to perfection are extremely
    rare in business. He is up there with Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and John Rockerfeller.
    History will show this to be true.

On Wednesday I had a meeting with Rutger-Jan van Spaandonk who is the executive director and shareholder of the <a href="http://www.core.co.za">Core Group</a>. In case you don't know Core Group are the official distributors for <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo</a> and <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/">Tom Tom</a> in South Africa.
RJ is an interesting man and he gave us a full status quo of where <em>his</em> products are placed in the SA market which was fascinating. What was more interesting though was when he told <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a>, <a href="http://rantofnote.blogspot.com/">Carly</a> and myself that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> owns a small stake in Apple Inc.
The big Apple vs. Microsoft war seems rather pointless after news of this so I decided I wanted to quantify this statement with some facts.
Turns out that at the 1997 Macworld Expo, Steve Jobs announced that Apple would be entering into partnership with Microsoft. Included in this was a five-year commitment from Microsoft to release Microsoft Office for Macintosh as well as an investment of 150,000 shares of Apple Series A, nonvoting, convertible preferred stock worth $150 million.
Steve had this to say to the audience.
<blockquote>If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do a good job, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not somebody else&acirc;&euro;&trade;s fault, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s our fault. So I think that is a very important perspective. If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude; we like their software.
</blockquote>
Microsoft found themselves in a monopolisation legal battle and Bill Gates recognised that if Apple failed Microsoft would have no case that there were other, alternative operating systems available to consumers. It was a win-win situation for both companies.
The 150,000 shares were convertible by Microsoft after August 5, 2000 into shares of the company&acirc;&euro;&trade;s common stock at a conversion price of $8.25 per share. During 2000, 74,250 shares of preferred stock were converted to 9 million shares and in 2001 the remaining 75,750 preferred shares were converted into 9.2 million of Apple&acirc;&euro;&trade;s common stock. All 18.2 million shares were sold by Microsoft in 2003.
Currently, Microsoft owns about 0.0046% of Apple through a Private Capital Management fund and Apple owns about 0.39% of itself the same way so whether Microsoft ever held any power in the company is questionable at best.
