  content: I'm still not convinced that this offers anything that will distinguish
    it from Twitter, but am keen to see how things progress. Good luck and well done
    on making a positive and gutsy move.

  content: Thx Pete, yes, at the moment it doesn't offer that much more or less, but
    the thing is, WE can develop it. That's the major difference, I guess... and you
    can bank on it it will evolve!

  content: "I think GatorPeeps is a really cool tool. I worked on something similar
    but it never took off so I killed it :). As a tool to connect AfriGator clients
    I think that it is great. I also like the idea behind Yammer - http://yammer.com
    - where u can setup company \"groups\".\r\n\r\nI am watching GatorPeeps with interest.
    Did u actually submit that check to Twitter or is that a joke? :)"

    and market that strongly instead of drawing unncessary parallelism with Twitter.
    That is my candid opinion, so please look at this angle and perfect your niche.

    If all the SA peeps moved to Gatorpeeps and the discussions were happening there
    you'd have no choice but to move. Who else would you talk to?\r\n\r\n@myphotographer

The news is finally out that Afrigator has <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2009/05/11/afrigator-launches-gatorpeeps/">officially launched</a> Gatorpeeps. <a href="http://gatorpeeps.com">Gatorpeeps</a> is our very own micro-blogging platform that we hope will connect our vastly growing community of users.
One of the biggest problems we've had is that we sit with more than 12,000 users but we've had no way to connect these users together. We've had numerous requests to allow <a href="http://gatorpeeps.com/community/peeps">peeps</a> to connect with other like-minded African users and for a long time we've been trying to figure out the right way to do it.
When we sat down to work the model out <a href="http://stii.co.za">Stii</a> had this ingenious idea to buy <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> so, we made them an offer. Unfortunately our offer of R250,000 was rejected and the result is that we decided to build our own platform instead.
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/05/twitter-cheque1.jpg" alt="Twitter Cheque" />
At first glance Gatorpeeps may appear to be competing with Twitter but let me assure you we're certainly not trying to compete or steal Twitter users but rather leverage off the technology to enhance our existing product. 
In truth we modeled a lot of Gatorpeeps off the best that both Twitter and <a href="http://www.jaiku.com">Jaiku</a> had to offer. Twitter has certainly brought micro-blogging to the mainstream and Jaiku revolutionised community interaction and we wanted to bring the simplicity of both into our offering.
So the question then is if we have such amazing micro-blogging platforms already why would we need another? Well, in a review of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/10_micro-blogging_tools_compared.php">ten micro-blogging platforms</a> <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a> had this to say in their conclusion:
<blockquote>Micro-blogging isn't a short-term trend - it is here to stay. The evolution of blogging has spawned this new mini version of blogging and many are latching on. The simplicity and ability to post frequently are what attract most to the concept. We expect much faster adoption and mainstream penetration than blogging in general.
</blockquote>
I believe this is even more true in Africa as we simply don't have the penetration that other developed countries have. Also take into consideration that the mobile phone remains the African version of the PC and as such micro-blogging addresses both penetration and accessibility problems. If you take Gatorpeeps into this context, couple it with the fact that <em><strong>less than 5%</strong></em> of Afrigator users have Twitter accounts then you'll see why launching a micro-blogging platform to our audience is in fact a wise move.
