I found this video via <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/internet-power-1995-video-explaining-internet">Common Craft</a> which is a digital version of a VHS tape educating people about the Internet. It's amazing to watch how <em>ground-breaking</em> the Internet was in 1995 and it makes you wonder what people will be saying about the Internet in 2018.
