  content: I wonder who actually updated the info. It had to be an insider in the
    know.

  content: He is actually theoretically still the Minister of Finance, just like Thabo
    Mbeki is still the President. Until Parliament accepts the resignations and appoints
    their replacement (assuming they do) they are still in those positions. In the
    case of Manuel, if he is reappointed Minister of Finance by the new President
    he would never actually have left the job!

  content: Yes correct. And we all know he's simply going to be re-instated anyway.

Picked this up on Twitter thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/NadiaPadayachi/statuses/931568435">Nadia Padayachi</a>. A group of people have already updated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Manuel">Trevor Manuel's Wikipedia entry</a> with the news of his resignation only a couple hours ago.
The new text now reads:
<blockquote>"Trevor Andrew Manuel (born 31 January 1956) served as South Africa's Minister of Finance. He was Finance Minister from 1996 until 2008, making him one of the country's longest-serving finance ministers."
</blockquote>
The power of social media I guess!
