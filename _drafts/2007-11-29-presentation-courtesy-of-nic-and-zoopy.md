Many thanks firstly to <a href="http://nicharalambous.com">Nic</a> who was clever enough to film my presentation at the 27dinner and secondly to <a href="http://blog.zoopy.com">Jason</a> at <a href="http://zoopy.com">Zoopy</a> who went out of his way to get this video up on their server. I was having loads of difficulty uploading the video but Jason quickly jumped in to help out. The irony in all of this is that YouTube, the largest video sharing site on the web, rejected this very video on the grounds that it was too long - go figure!
