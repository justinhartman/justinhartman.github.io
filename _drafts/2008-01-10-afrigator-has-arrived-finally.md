7 months. That's how long this Beta version took us to finalise and while it's not completely finished yet we decided to move it onto the live server late last night.
The <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2008/01/10/afrigator-launches-public-beta-site/">official announcement</a> contains a fairly detailed list of what has changed and it would be great to get your feedback on this new version. Head on over to <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> and test the new system out.
