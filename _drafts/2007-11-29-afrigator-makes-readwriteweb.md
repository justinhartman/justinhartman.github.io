I know the last few posts have been dedicated to the new Afrigator beta launch but being featured on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">Read/WriteWeb</a> doesn't happen every day!
<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/about_marshall.php">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> is a Lead Author at Read/WriteWeb and was previously a lead blogger at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> and he's written a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/afrigator.php">glowing review</a> on the Afrigator beta site.
This is an amazing achievement for us and I'm really happy to see the International community finding true value in what we've created. If you like the review please take a moment to <a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/Afrigator_The_Best_of_African_Social_Media_in_Real_Time/who">Digg the post here</a> or <a href="http://muti.co.za/comments?sbid=13076">vote it up on Muti</a>.
