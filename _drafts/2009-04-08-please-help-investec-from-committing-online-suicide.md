  content: Good for you for addressing this. It never ceases to amaze me how many
    large corporates websites don't work on the most basic level! Try finding where
    to buy an LG appliance on http://za.lge.com! Simplicity is the ultimate in sophistication.

  content: "Well it's certainly progressive but like you say, it's not appropriate
    given their industry and user demographic.\r\n\r\nThe navigation is too unconventional,
    and not worth the effort or time it requires to understand how it all works (once
    you've found and activated it first). I really don't like how there are arrows
    to indicate a secondary-level menu for each item, but not all items have a secondary-level.
    So visually and functionally, the heirachy is confusing.\r\n\r\nAnd then if you
    click on the \"Corporate Clients\" arrow (not text, otherwise that loads up the
    page), and then \"Capital Markets\", and select an item, it will take you another
    few clicks to close this clickstream and navigate to somewhere else. Way too many
    clicks.\r\n\r\nThe buttons to keep the sidebars open/closed aren't obvious because,
    at least, they don't have any tooltips explaining their function. I'm not sure
    a lock is the correct icon here either - lock iconography in banking environments
    communicate security.\r\n\r\nAlso as your screenshot shows, the layout fits to
    the full width of the browser viewport but the content area doesn't benefit from
    this as it's fixed width, so what's the point? The content is always boxed into
    a small scrollable area with so much wasted white space in the header.\r\n\r\nThey
    should be using a print-specific style sheet for print-friendly pages.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I guess they will have to revisit their Accessibility statement: http://beta.investec.com/en_za/#home/legal/accessibility.html\r\n\r\nA
    very confusing redesign."

  content: "@Coda I agree. It is a confusing redesign.\r\n\r\n@Ross technically there
    isn't an iframe. What they've done is load all the content through Ajax (JS) so
    the point being there is none of the content being displayed in the source code
    of the site.\r\n\r\nAll you ever see in the source code is links to the pages
    but following those links you still don't see the content.\r\n\r\nI took it a
    step further. I viewed the beta site in Lynx (a Linux command line browser) because
    Lynx is know to replicate what search engines see. Here is what Lynx displays.\r\n\r\n/assets/images/uploads/2009/04/picture-48.png\r\n\r\nWhat
    you can clearly see is that a SE is never going to be able to index any content
    for the new site. Even when I followed the redirect URL all that displayed was
    a blank page.\r\n\r\nI can't stress enough how important the search engine strategy
    needs to be."

  content: "Hi Justin,\r\n\r\nInteresting read on your take of their website changes.
    I couldn't agree more that the font is too small.\r\n\r\nI have perfect 20/ 20
    vision and could see it clearly, but it was annoyingly small.\r\n\r\nThe \"hidden,\"
    market indicators could certainly be structured differently.\r\n\r\nOverall I
    found the site very clean though and it appealed to me, but overall, when their
    current demographic is considered, your comments are certainly valid. This of
    course includes the SEO aspect of their website.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they are also
    aiming to now attract a \"newer,\" demographic?"

  content: "I tried to give them some feedback but I don't have that much time on
    my hands to help out :)\r\n\r\nWithout rehashing the critical points of confusion
    that people have already mentioned, I think if they completely redesign their
    navigation and better use containing space, they will go a long way to making
    it more usable.  Again, font sizing and spacing is problematic, please fix it
    too.\r\n\r\nNot sure why they went so radical on the design.  Seems like an insecure
    design trying to be completely different.  Or they derive inspiration from a very
    \"vacuum-like\" web design; looks great in a PSD but is impractical in execution."

  content: "oi currumba! Well spotted Justin.\r\n\r\nWrong approach (technology, navigation,
    design, architecture) for a banking site.\r\n\r\nWhere do we begin:\r\n\r\n- I
    do believe this kind of web dev has a place, but it certainly ain't on a banking
    site (or at least occupying the core part of the site). The site should be functional,
    clean, focused, professional, widely accessible.\r\n\r\n- Wrong technology choice
    aside, the basics are problematic: navigation is muddled and unclear and that
    big cheesy background image should go.\r\n\r\n- I'm a big fan of new technologies,
    but this is not right. It looks someone is having a party with the Javascript
    EXT framework... it belongs on some sites, but not here!!\r\n\r\n- I'm a big fan
    of pushing the boundaries... ie the Ster Kinekor site which is completely flash-based,
    I think works in that context (not all agree)... but for investec this is wrong
    wrong wrong\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's they have done right:\r\n\r\n- Launch it as a beta
    for comment\r\n\r\n- Create a survey to get opinion\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's going to be
    a major embarrassment if they launch this thing. Investec is a premium, widely-respected
    brand... this site does not belong that. I hope they make a sensible business
    decision here and not get sentimental about what they've developed. It needs to
    go back to the drawing board!!"

    you, is that Investec have been open to feedback and I hope they use all the comments
    in this post as a benchmark for some changes.\r\n\r\nI have little doubt that
    had they launched this without feedback it would have turned nasty but in doing
    what they did they've allowed any potential issues to be mitigated by taking in
    feedback and (hopefully) listening."

  content: In trying to be cool and fresh , Investec have ignored almost every usability
    guideline, and rule in the book. Their beta site is completley unusable in the
    current form. Navigation is a nighmare, it is completely unintuative, and actually
    finding anything is a real challenge. Research has now shown the 7 second rule
    is more like 5 seconds, and users scan for information, they dont read, users
    also dont remember navigation, it must be intuative and consistent. Who knows
    what they were thinking. To their credit they did not go live with this. Investec
    have always been the lowest scoring, by a long way, in the World Wide Worx Webagility
    system. Standard Bank leads with around a 70% score, the other banks ABSA 64%,
    Nedbank 58% FNB 55% and Investec old site around 40% for usability. The new site
    may even score lower than 40%.

    that you've all said in response to Justin's post. I'm also glad that this hasn't
    got messy, instead positive feedback is being offered to Investec.\r\n\r\nI do
    hope they take this feedback VERY seriously, as going live with the BETA proposed
    would be \"Online Suicide\" as Justin puts it.\r\n\r\nI'm impressed that they
    did launch as a Beta first and encourage feedback (even if it was through a free
    online poll system with a single manditory field).\r\n\r\nClearly Investec has
    a lot more to learn about web strategy.\r\n\r\nWithout opening a can of worms
    I would like to know what company or person has been guiding Investec towards
    this outcome?"

<a href="http://www.investec.com">Investec Bank</a>, a company I've long admired, is about to ruin their hard earned reputation online. On the Investec homepage there is a graphic enticing users to test drive their new website located at <a href="http://beta.investec.com">http://beta.investec.com</a>. This is what it looks like.
<a href="http://beta.investec.com/"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/04/picture-47-500x241.png" alt="Investec Bank&#039;s new beta site" title="Investec Bank&#039;s new beta site" width="500" height="241" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-640" /></a>
I doubt that it's just me but the new Investec site is simply unusable and I'm struggling to see how their clients are going to be happy with the new interface. While the site is certainly pushing boundaries in terms of web design I have to ask one simple question. Why?
Let me explain why I think this site is bad for them:
<ul>
<li>The site is largely built using JavaScript. This is bad news for Search Engines and if you happen to have JavaScript disabled in your browser (many browsers do) then the site simply doesn't load.</li>
<li>All content is loaded in an iframe. Once again, bad news for Search Engines as their content is never going to be indexed correctly. This leaves a major gap for Investec competitors who's sites are optimised for SEO.</li>
<li>Font size of the content is so small that their major base of clients over the age of 45 are really going to have a tough time reading it.</li>
<li>Navigation is extremely unintuitive. At first glance it looks like the site is still loading because you don't see any navigation bars. Eventually you figure out that if you hover on the smaller buttons to the left and right the real navigation bars appear. Using the 7 second rule new visitors to this site will simply close the browser window and move onto the next site.</li>
<li>The market indicators appear to be hidden in the bottom bar. We figured out that you actually need to click the indicators to have them pop up. There is no message or call to action informing people that they should click this bar to read more.</li>
</ul>
Investec have a one question survey about their new beta site and I urge anyone who likes this brand to take the survey and tell them to rethink their strategy. I don't particularly like to hammer brands on my blog but I'm actually trying to help them out.
Please take the short survey <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/survey.zgi?p=WEB228YNZQP5E3">by clicking on this link</a>. I hope that you'll agree with me that they should rather stick to their current site until they've revised this beta one.
