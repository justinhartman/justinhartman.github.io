    spreading more bullshit, why don't you learn about the history here, because you
    clearly haven't been following it for the past 9 years.\r\n\r\na. Eskom's planning
    indicated as far back as 1998 that their capacity would hold until 2007.  Here's
    a reference (incidentally on the Cabora Bassa issue): http://www.btimes.co.za/99/0530/news/news06.htm\r\n\r\nb.
    Government's white paper on energy policy in 1998 warned of supply shortages in
    2007.  Here's a reference: http://www.gsb.uct.ac.za/newsletter/v2/Story.asp?intArticleID=1337
    \r\nThe rest of that article is worth reading too.\r\n\r\nc. If you didn't read
    the rest of the article: in 2001 government prohibited eskom from infrastructure
    development, intending to unbundle eskom and/or encourage private investment.
    \ Further government delays held back any planning for extending generation capacity
    until 2005.\r\n\r\nd. Cabora Bassa supplies 950MW to SA.  Its total capacity is
    2075MW.  We are - today - 4000MW short _after_ the 950MW from CB.\r\n\r\ne. We
    suspended power sales to neighbouring countries earlier this week.  We are STILL
    4000MW short.\r\n\r\nf. The only responsibility eskom bears in this situation
    is failure to adequately maintain certain infrastructure.  We are 4000MW short
    because of 5000MW of _unplanned_ outages."

    until 2007. But if you read the complete report (not the edited one) you would
    find that of the recommendations provided, some of it related to adequate continuation
    of maintenance programmes which would have extended capacity to 2009/2010 ...
    and Eskom had the funding for it\r\n\r\n2. The real problem is not just the fact
    that the energy regulator and parliment failed to act and provide more funding.
    ... privatisation drives, et ...al\r\n\r\nOne of the major problems arises out
    of the fact that many \"Maintenance Contractors\" were replaced by unskilled or
    insufficiently qualified contractors. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the \"Free-for-all\"
    and corrupt relationships between some contractors and some commercial managers
    / power station personnel also has had a role to play. I.e. Such as some contractors
    being paid for work not delivered. Lack of preventative maintenance ... although
    Eskom spent its budgets on some so called \"maintenance projects\" which were
    mainly of a short-term rather than long-term\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting that
    currently Eskom is on a mjor recruitment drive, and is in fact recruiting previous
    employees (retrenched between 95 and 99) at an amasing rate and pay and that they
    have widened the \"Supply net\" to include previous suppliers (although some of
    the smaller ones lost their business in the interim)."

  content: "I don't want to jinx things, but I am convinced some Eskom bigshot stays
    in my area because we have had a total of ONE power cut - from 1am to 3am one
    night.\r\n\r\nFor your interest, I was send this article from the Mail and Guardian
    today\r\nhttp://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=330574&amp;area=/insight/insight__economy__business\r\n\r\nEnergy
    crisis? What energy crisis?\r\n \r\nJocelyn Newmarch and Kevin Davie | Johannesburg,
    South Africa\r\n25 January 2008\r\n \r\nSouth Africa has plenty of energy available.
    The problem is, we don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have enough power\r\n \r\nSome of
    the country&acirc;&euro;&trade;s biggest businesses have been queuing up to sell
    power to Eskom. The potential power on the table -- all 5 000MW of it -- is almost
    equivalent to two Koeberg-sized nuclear power stations.\r\n \r\nTo put this into
    context, the rolling load-shedding that has been causing so much distress to so
    many results from power shortages of about 3 000MW.\r\n \r\nIf you scratch the
    energy sector, speaking to players large and small, a picture emerges of any number
    of players who are keen to supply energy to Eskom from sources as diverse as hydro,
    diesel generators, biogas, biomass, wood and solar.\r\n \r\nThe problem, they
    say, is that monopolist Eskom is prepared to pay only half of what it charges
    for electricity.\r\n \r\nInvestors say they also need certainty. They could build
    capacity now at relatively high cost only to find Eskom refusing to purchase their
    power when the crisis eases.\r\n \r\nThese alternative sources are generally more
    costly than coal-fired power, but many are kinder to the environment. Another
    advantage is that it would be relatively quick to construct the necessary infrastructure,
    unlike the 10 years it takes to construct a large power station.\r\n \r\nMuch
    of this alternative electricity is being produced anyway, as part of industrial
    processes as diverse as sewage processing, sugar refining and paper-making.\r\n
    \r\nIt appears that much of this electricity could have been fed into the national
    grid by now, but this has been held up by red tape, price disputes and reluctance
    to sign on new providers.\r\n \r\nLarge projects involving hundreds of megawatts
    of electricity are under discussion. Paper giant Sappi, for instance, is keen
    to build 150 megawatts of capacity to supply its own needs and that of the grid.
    Sappi&acirc;&euro;&trade;s electricity is produced as part of the paper-making
    process.\r\n \r\nThere is also scope for relatively small-scale renewable energy
    projects to make a dramatic contribution to the grid. Government has been working
    on an approach intended to encourage small users of clean energy to supply the
    grid. As is the case in a host of countries internationally, suppliers of green
    energy are paid a special feed-in tariff (FIT) to encourage the development of
    new, cleaner forms of energy.\r\n \r\nOne source says about 5 000MW could be generated
    through the use of FITs.\r\n \r\nThere were hopes that a new dispensation to encourage
    FIT&acirc;&euro;&trade;s would be announced early this year and that it would
    contribute towards diversifying energy supply from Eskom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    clutches but, the source says, the process remains in a muddle somewhere between
    the regulator and Eskom head office, with signs that the provision of renewable
    energy may also be controlled and monopolised by Eskom.\r\nLegally, electricity
    producers may only sell to Eskom or to municipalities distributing electricity.\r\n
    \r\nThe relatively large projects under discussion are known as co-&Acirc;&shy;generation.
    This power comes from a range of sources. Tongaat-Hulett and Illovo produce electricity
    from sugar bagasse, for example, while four of Sappi&acirc;&euro;&trade;s eight
    mills produce electricity. Methane can be collected from sewerage works, and small
    businesses can run diesel generators. Pooling all of these sources could potentially
    save the cost of a new power station.\r\n \r\nEven Massmart produces electricity,
    with Makro stores in the Western Cape running generators for their stores even
    when Eskom power is available. This reduces demand on the national grid and helps
    avoid load-shedding, and Eskom subsidises the company for this. Massmart CEO Grant
    Pattison told I-Net Bridge that he would like all Makro stores to run generators
    in this way.\r\n \r\nSappi spokesperson Andre Oberholzer said the company will
    produce more than 50% of its own energy requirements at its mills, following an
    expansion project in the middle of the year. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The co-gen process
    has been frustrating and has taken a very long time. In fact, we would have been
    ready to implement some projects had the co-gen process already been finalised,&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    he said.\r\n \r\nCo-generation has been discussed for the past few years, with
    little progress. The sticking point until now has been the price. Although much
    secrecy surrounds the proposed pricing for co-generated power, the price has been
    based on the avoided cost to Eskom of generating coal-fired electricity. Because
    Eskom produced the cheapest electricity in the world, and had not invested in
    new stations until now, there was not much scope for private sector production,
    said Frost analyst Cornelis van der Waal.\r\n \r\nBut steep increases have been
    granted for this year and Eskom is making new investments. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;The
    14,2% increase in electricity tariffs is moving in the right direction,&acirc;&euro;\x9D
    he said, explaining that the higher prices made co-generation more viable for
    companies. &acirc;&euro;&oelig;We&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve seen that a lot of people
    are willing to pay extra for electricity, especially industry. There is a need
    for increased electricity prices,&acirc;&euro;\x9D said Van der Waal.\r\n \r\nBut
    electricity regulator Thembani Bukula of Nersa says that prices agreed on for
    co-generation would also take into account the cost of production. The tariff
    Eskom is allowed to charge its consumers also includes a &acirc;&euro;&oelig;reasonable
    return&acirc;&euro;\x9D, which is currently 8%, but Bukula says co-generators
    would be granted a higher return. At present, he said, the price of co-generation
    &acirc;&euro;&oelig;does not look prohibitive&acirc;&euro;\x9D. FITs, which are
    associated with renewable energy, are still under discussion.\r\n \r\nBianca Belinska,
    from Nersa, confirmed that the regulator is considering Eskom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    proposal whereby 50% of the renewable energy required by the country would be
    supplied by Eskom, and the remaining 50% would be bought from independent producers
    by Eskom. South Africa needs to source 10 000 gigawatt hours of electricity from
    renewable sources by 2013. Currently, this is being modelled on a mix of wind
    and concentrated solar power, she said. She said discussions were continuing between
    government, the regulator and Eskom on these issues and all proposals were being
    considered.\r\n \r\nBut Bukula said Eskom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s proposal had not
    yet been formally presented to the regulator. He expected Eskom to present its
    proposal as part of the public participation process for the regulator&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    assessment of FITs.\r\n \r\nElectricity from co-generation projects could be added
    to the national grid in 2009, said Bukula, and Eskom is expecting to tie up agreements
    by June. So far, just one agreement has been signed, with Sasol.\r\n \r\nCo-generation
    agreements could be bad news for Amatola Green Power, which buys excess electricity
    from the sugar companies, adds this energy to the national pool, and then sells
    it to clients. Amatola supplies electricity from renewable energy and has a temporary
    licence which it hopes will be formalised soon. If a co-generation agreement is
    signed with Tongaat-Hulett and Illovo, Amatola may be competing with Eskom to
    buy up the electricity.\r\n \r\nThe example of Kerala, India, offers an even quicker
    solution, according to businesswoman Sally Hall. She said Kerala&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    equivalent of the Industrial Development Corporation had offered financing to
    hundreds of households and small businesses to buy diesel generators, which steadily
    fed power back to the national grid with a maximum output of 10kW in peak time.
    No tenders had been put out, but the Kerala state electricity board had advertised
    the rate it was prepared to pay for power. The generators were paid back over
    five years, while the return offered was better than a bank deposit and included
    a 30% profit. The programme was rolled out in three months, Hall said.\r\n \r\nAn
    incentive programme for solar water heaters could significantly reduce demand,
    as the equivalent of a large power station (2 000MW) is used to provide hot water
    to the domestic sector alone. Once the effects of co-generation, renewable power
    and reduced demand through solar heaters are pooled, there should be no power
    crisis.\r\n \r\nEnergy crisis What energy crisis Mail &amp; Guardian Online"

    presented here as I simply don't have the experience to but what I will say is
    this.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 a college I worked with had a friend who was top management
    at Eskom. He informed her that Eskom had a very serious problem and if our capacity
    grew this country would be in serious problems. He also said they ship so much
    power to neighbouring countries and this was part of the issue for capacity in
    SA.\r\n\r\nNow I believe that Eskom are hiding behind the fact that they reported
    this crisis to government as early as 1998 and in truth I think they just never
    bothered to do much about it. This was fueled by Government rejecting an upgrade
    plan to infrastructure and now it's simply easier to shift the blame to the gov.
    than to take responsibility.\r\n\r\nR54 million in bonuses paid to Eskom exec's

    is increasing at an alarming rate. But then there are alternatives which Eskom
    and goverment are not considering, in fact because of \"Regulation\" ... after
    all ESKOM has the monopoly on energy ... which has caused alternatives to be on
    holt or progressing very slowly.\r\n\r\nThis is a much more complex issue ...

  content: "Power Shedding\r\n\r\n \r\nPower Shedding is back, at least in Gauteng.
    \ I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m not sure what is happening in the rest of the country
    but I presume it happening everywhere.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve listened to the
    traffic reports this morning, spoke to some people and received a lot of report
    of inconvenience and disruptions.\r\n\r\nWe called the Powergroup into life during
    January this year in the mist of Load Shedding.  Shortly thereafter Load Shedding
    stopped and everybody was happy again.  This weeks Load Shedding according to
    Eskom is due to &acirc;&euro;&tilde;n sudden demand of Electricity due to the
    cold weather.  This of course is just &acirc;&euro;&tilde;n forerunner in the
    small for the winter on hands.  What&acirc;&euro;&trade;s happening now will just
    repeat on a much bigger scale in the winter to come.  In the mean time at least
    4 of Eskom generators are out of commission.  This just reflects back to the reports
    brought out by www.forensies.com which indicated a lack of planning and maintenance
    on the whole Electricity grit.  \r\n\r\nIn the mean time Eskom shifts the blame
    to the consumer.  They show their teeth and indicate if we do not use less power
    we will feel their grunt.  I agree, we must use less electricity to get through
    this crisis, but we must also demand heads to roll of people who are the authors
    of this crisis and replace them with competent people who does not only do the
    talk, but also do the walk.  If one&acirc;&euro;&trade;s look at Eskom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    financial statements it is clear on their own account that they are the only authors
    of the electricity crisis.\r\n\r\nMillion of people had billions of damages due
    to mismanagement of Eskom and it is time to claim back that was taken away en
    pressurize Eskom and Government to implement a plan of action and not just talk
    about it.\r\n\r\nI spoke to a lot op people who indicated that what will it help
    to take on a giant like Eskom.  There is a duty on everyone of us to act now.
    \ If we do not act we will give Eskom and the Government the green light to proceed
    with mismanagement.  Just look at our roads, look at our municipalities, look
    at the state of our rivers, and look at the state of service in government organizations.
    \ Government organizations are kept alive by business that is forced to do the
    work of Government officials if business wants to keep the economy alive.  I see
    at the Masters Office, Magistrate Courts, and Municipality Offices.  How long
    will we tolerate this?\r\n\r\nI&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been criticized that I am
    using emotions and religion to make profit out of an unfortunate crisis in the
    country.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve been criticized that I am busy with touting.
    I believe that God uses people to bring change about.  This means that God will
    use people to turn our country back to the country it is supposed to be.  I am
    willing to stand up and make a difference.  Are you?\r\n\r\nIf everyone runs away
    from the problems in our beautiful South Africa with all of its opportunities,
    I will stil be here because I believe in this country.  I know what God has in
    store for this Country and I know that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve got a purpose in
    this country, do you?\r\n\r\nI the mean time Eskom bosses cant wait for the 31
    of March 2008 due in 13 days when they will receive an huge bonus of more than
    R10 Million for allowing this Electricity crises and all we can do is complain,
    criticize en point  fingers but doing nothing, I repeat nothing at all.  When
    will we wake up? When will we put our money where our mouth is?\r\n\r\nPowergroup
    is waiting in anticipation for South Africans and anybody who wants to make a
    difference in this beautiful country.  Powergroup with their experts www.forensies.com
    are already in the position to prove in court that Eskom was negligent in managing
    electricity in South Africa.  According to their own financial statements there
    is more than enough money available to build more power stations and to pay out
    damages to people who have been hit hard by this crisis.  This has been so for
    the last 10 years.  If we do not act, where will we be in 10 years?\r\n\r\nIf
    we unite and stand together we will be the Giant who can force Eskom and Government
    to act now and we can be through this crisis before we know it.  Thereafter we
    as citizens wil be able to force municipalities and governmental institutions
    to perform the duties and restore our country to the state it is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nRiaan

<blockquote>ESKOM CE Jacob Maroga has urged business not to rely on the government to find solutions to power shortages likely to persist until 2013, when the utility will have significantly expanded its generation capacity. - <a href="http://mybroadband.co.za/news/General/2639.html">MyADSL</a>

Day 16 of the rolling power outages and we're all feeling the very serious impact this is having on our lives. Funny how the Eskom CE has made this statement because while we're all sitting in the dark - sometimes three times a day - our politicians appear to be exempt from said <em>load shedding</em>.
One of my closest friends lives in Killarney and during this 16 day trauma she's had to endure the grand total of <strong>zero</strong> blackouts. Seems a little odd as Killarney is one of the hardest hit areas for load shedding but the difference with her is that she lives in the same road as Thabo Mbeki and Trevor Manuel. Another friend lives near Jacob Zuma's residence in Forrest Town and alas they're also unaffected by this <em>load shedding</em>.
Once again it's an <em>us</em> and <em>them</em> scenario and as long as JZ and crew remain unaffected by this power crisis we've got no hope of Government doing anything to resolve this issue.
