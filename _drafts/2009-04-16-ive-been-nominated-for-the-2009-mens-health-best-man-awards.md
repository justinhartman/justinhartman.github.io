<img align="right" src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/04/mens-health.jpg" alt="2009 Men's Health Best Man Award" />Yesterday I received a notification that I've been nominated for the <em>2009 Men's Health Best Man Awards</em>. To be honest I'm blown away but before I get into that here's what the awards are all about.
<blockquote>Every year a few men stand out from the crowd. They inspire us, challenge us and lead us to greater heights of personal and professional achievement. Men's Health magazine believes that these men deserve to be recognised and so the Best Man Awards was born.
As the first campaign of its kind in South Africa; Men's Health Best Man aims to reward our country's top achievers for the ground-breaking work they have accomplished. We've highlighted six categories - sports, media, business, arts and culture, public service and science and technology - and after an exhaustive process by our expert panel selected the finalists who represent the Best Man. These men were profiled in the May issue of Men's Health from which the final three in each category are then selected. The Best Man winner in each category will then be announced at the final Best Man Awards dinner.
</blockquote>
This year I've been chosen as one of eight nominees in the Media category and very shortly they'll be narrowing this list down to three finalists. The other nominees in the Media category that I'm competing with are:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zapiro.com">Jonathan 'Zapiro' Shapiro</a> (do I even need to tell you who Zapiro is?)</li>
<li><a href="http://multimedia.thetimes.co.za/audio/2008/10/paul-holden-the-arms-deal-in-your-pocket/">Paul Holden</a> (author of The Arms Deal in Your Pocket)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.speakersofnote.co.za/speakers.php?action=view&spid=289">Solly Philander</a> (multi-award winning performer)</li>
<li><a href="http://velocityfilms.com/thabo-marera/">Thabo Marera</a> (award winning commercial director)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sabenvironment.co.za/index.php?page=past_winners">Danie van der Walt</a> (award winning journalist and executive producer of the environmental programme 50/50)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/south_africa_in_the_world/sa_cameraman_wins_top_award_.html">Garwin McLuckie</a> (award winning SA cameraman)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.matthewbuckland.com">Matthew Buckland</a> (GM, Social Media 24.com)</li>
</ul>
This is an impressive list of contenders and I really am extremely grateful to the powers that be for nominating me and even considering me amongst these top professionals. It really is a nice feeling being nominated for such a prestigious award and although I'm thankful I have to warn <em>Men's Health</em> that I'm not taking my shirt off for the cover photo shoot when I win! :)
