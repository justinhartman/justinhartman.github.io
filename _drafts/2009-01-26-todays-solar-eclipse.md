I knew an eclipse was imminent - I just didn't know when it was. Luckily though the cloud cover around this morning's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse">solar eclipse</a> allowed me to get a few shots. The beauty of this shot is that I wasn't expecting it and I only had a window of about 2 minutes. Soon after I took this pic the cloud cover disappeared and I could no longer look directly at the eclipse and it was impossible to take further photos.
