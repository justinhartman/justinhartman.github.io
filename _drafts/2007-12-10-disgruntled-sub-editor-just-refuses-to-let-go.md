  content: "I second Dave&acirc;&euro;&trade;s point and I agree on all Justin&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    points -- except most definitely point 5, which raises the ominous question of
    &acirc;&euro;&oelig;industrial sabotage&acirc;&euro;\x9D on our behalf. It's a
    very serious allegation -- and I should state categorically there is no such thing
    and that it is nonsense.\r\n\r\nRemember, we don't tell ThoughtLeader bloggers
    what to write about. All of the 700 posts we have so far are issues chosen by
    the bloggers themselves.\r\n\r\nWe asked our editor for his reasons on why he
    approved the post in question &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and to him it seemed rather
    innocuous at the time of approving. It only took on significance after the action
    to fire Kriel. Furthermore our editor himself used to be a sub-editor and for
    him it raised important questions about issues that all newsrooms are facing these
    days in SA.\r\n\r\nAlso our editor is not sensitised to the issues between Avusa
    and its employees. He cannot get involved in the specifics involving relationships
    between people and their companies re: what they may or may not do... it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    up to them to police. As Dave said, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s between Llewellyn
    Kriel and Avusa. Frankly, it's none of our business.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that
    I do think this is a new media issue. I agree the blog angle has sensationalised
    this issue, but never-the-less it is still worth talking about and it is interesting
    that it happened via a blog&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; the fact that it happened on
    a competitor platform is probably irrelevant. ie... \r\n\r\nI think this is worth
    talking about, not shutting down the debate..."

  content: "Guys, honestly - why bring up sabotage and say you don't believe it?  Justin
    needs to explain why it's worth putting it on the agenda if he doesn't believe
    it - does this mean there are people who do, and on what basis?  This is a serious
    thing to put out there, not something to be said lightly.\r\n\r\nHere is an email
    I sent to Justin on my feelings about this matter and I was planning to keep this
    conversation off-line originally but the more I think about it, the more the red
    herring about sabotage irritates me:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\"The way I see it
    there are 3 things going on here:\r\n\r\n1. Kriel was fired for breach of confidentiality,
    this is clear to everyone\r\n\r\nThe questions it raises are the following:\r\n\r\n2.
    Is the internal working of the media something that can be\r\nprotected by corporate
    policy or is it more important for the public\r\nto know?  If you see media strictly
    as a business then yes, corporate\r\npolicy can dictate what information must
    be public knowledge.  If, on\r\nthe other hand, you see the media as playing a
    formative social role -\r\nand this is the general consensus in terms of media
    theory - then a\r\nsituation affecting the way a media company produces its product
    is\r\ngenuinely in the public interest because it affects them directly.  To\r\ngive
    you an example, readers of the paper will generally use what the\r\npaper contains
    as their own news agenda.  If what the paper says is\r\nnews is being affected
    by cutbacks and corporate mismanagement then\r\npeople must know that their trusted
    news source can no longer be\r\ntrusted.\r\n\r\n3. Ignoring the specifics of how
    Thought Leader works, what this case\r\nhighlights is how much easier personal
    publishing tools make the\r\nviolation of corporate policy.  This is the new media
    angle.  Fools\r\nlike Catto who think they are above the law just because they
    have a\r\nblog are just adding noise around this issue - the crux is that before\r\nblogs
    you would have to go to a much greater effort to reach an\r\naudience of a few
    thousand to tell your secret to - now its so easy\r\npeople could not even realise
    the consequences until after.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was my and Arthur's choice of
    headline rather than the\r\nactual arguments that make you think we're looking
    at this thing from\r\none dimension only.  My main concern is how media professionals
    are\r\nnot questioning the blind following of corporate policy, but this is\r\nbecause
    I come from an academic background and see media as being a\r\npublic service
    first and a corporate concern second, in the bigger\r\nscheme of things.\"  \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNow,
    to those of you who agree that this can be reduced to the one-dimensional view
    that everything that happens is governed strictly by corporate policy, ask yourselves
    this - is this really your experience of how the world works?  \r\n\r\nThe fact
    is that Kriel has a self-acknowledged history of rubbing management up the wrong
    way at the Sowetan and in his previous positions at other papers.  This is actually
    reminiscent of a previous dismissal at another publication.  So obviously this
    is not only about a violation of corporate policy but also about the context in
    which the policy was violated, by whom, and who it affected aside from the company
    as a whole. People all over the place violate corporate policy all the time and
    are not fired for it, they are given a warning.\r\n\r\nAnother thing worth asking
    is why Avusa didn't ask us to take down the post that offended them.  I guess
    it would have been harder to hang Kriel's head on the city walls if the problem
    went away relatively quietly. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say these politics have nothing
    to do with the Mail &amp; Guardian and we weren't even aware of them when this
    thing went down - Kriel's comments about the media, insofar as they can be generalised,
    are important because the functioning of the media matters to the public.  So
    to suggest subtly that we're out to sabotage Avusa seems like a smokescreen, as
    is the focus on Ray's blog about the extremes of the arguments. As an example
    of a lack of double standard, our print editor has been criticised heavily on
    our own platform - taking criticism is part of the industry we're in, its what
    makes the media industry robust.\r\n\r\nAnd seeing as we're discussing this openly
    I'd like to see which bloggers exactly are saying that blogging is above the law,
    other than Catto, and whether they are representative of the whole. I'd also like
    to know why Justin initially decided not to link to our GM's post that <i>wasn't</i>
    critical of Avusa.\r\n\r\nNone of this is said to damage personal relationships,
    just to show that there actually is another side to this story."

  content: "Justin makes some valid points and by and large I agree that Kriel effectively
    committed cyber career suicide by venting his frustrations in a public forum.
    He should have known better. But, and here's the rub, irrespective of his lack
    of foresight, common sense and ability to curb his virtual tongue, the issues
    at the core of his ire should be scrutinised.\r\nOnce upon a time, I was the Deputy
    Chief Sub Editor of the Pretoria News, considered a good journalist by my peers
    but also something of a loose cannon. I began working for Aunty Argus in the early
    90s, a year or two before she was sold down the river to an Irish bean-canner
    known as O'Reilly. There then followed a ten-year period of steady degradation
    of both the products and morale in the once mighty Argus group which eventually
    led to me producing the capital's morning paper each night with a total of five
    sub editors (myself included).\r\nWe too went through a staff morale survey, a
    succession of MDs and jobs freeze. Stress levels were intense and only surpassed
    by the level of griping and moaning of subbing staff who had, on average, more
    than 90 days leave each owing to them due to the fact that for them to take leave
    would have made it impossible to produce the paper.\r\nI eventually cracked under
    the pressure, after a particularly hard night, and told my MD what I thought,
    like Kriel, in no uncertain terms in an e-mail which I then copied to heads of
    department at the Pretoria News.\r\nI then sent an e-mail to my immediate superior,
    who I thought was my best friend, berating my editor, deputy editor and the impossible
    working conditions. This e-mail somehow found its way into an unmarked envelope
    on the editor's desk, in spite of being private correspondence.\r\nI was disciplined
    and fired. I lost my CCMA case because I should have known better after 20 years
    in the business. Like Kriel, I refused to let go, took the case to the Labour
    Court and lost again.\r\nMy arguments at the time were Kriel's arguments. E-mail,
    and the changes it was making to the world of media, was the problematic new technology
    of the moment, just as blogging is the hot potato of today.\r\nIt isn't comforting
    to know that the problems I experienced all those years ago are still prevalent
    today. It's actually a cause for great concern. The print media houses of South
    Africa are living on borrowed time if they think that Kriel's public outburst
    is an isolated incident.\r\nWhile Justin is correct in his feeling that sensitive
    corporate information should not have been made public on a \"rival\" publication's
    site, it is perhaps interesting that the Mail &amp; Guardian picked up the pieces
    of me that Independent Newspapers threw to the floor, taking me under its wing
    as a freelance sub and writer, helping me to establish what is now a thriving
    career as an independent journalist writing what I want, when I want, and for
    who I want.\r\nYes, Avusa was justified in its actions. But consider the state
    of mind of a man, with 30 years experience under his belt, who has been driven
    to the apparent madness which cost him his job and livelihood.\r\nPerhaps it is
    time that the big print media moguls in this country looked inwards at the men
    and women who jump through hoops on a daily basis to help them achieve their profit
    margins, in spite of often impossible expectations. Every time a newspaper hits
    the street a team of people has collectively pulled a rabit out of a hat, created
    a silk purse from a sow's ear and fought the good fight of editorial integrity,
    sometimes in a company whose leaders cannot even spell those two words, let alone
    understand their meaning.\r\nGood sub editors are the backbone of the print media
    industry, and they are in short supply - ask any editor. If the press is truly
    to remain free in this country then it needs the experience and expertise of people
    like Kriel, people who have survived the dark days of apartheid and who know what
    this game is all about. Ultimately, what makes a good publication is not its profit
    margin, but the people who work hard to produce it. \r\nThere are some excellent
    writers in this country, but some would do well to remember that it's a sub who
    puts their copy on the page, fine tunes it and helps them to win the accolades
    without ever having a byline to say so. It's a sub who sits for hours on a full
    bladder on deadline hammering out the gremlins in copy, thinking up the hard-hitting
    headlines, the witty standfirsts and eye-grabbing pulls, cramming it all above
    the fold so it can sell the paper on the street, getting the job done with little,
    or no recognition.\r\nTo Mr Kriel I say this: let this go and get on with your
    life as quickly as you can and hopefully, like me, you will realise that the Sowetan
    has done you the best favour possible by setting you free from the shackles of
    boardroom journalism.\r\nTo the print media of South Africa I say this: rethink
    the way you do business - your biggest assets are your employees. Pay them well,
    treat them well and remember that they are human beings with lives that should
    not revolve around you. You are not the centre of their universe but they are
    the core of yours.\r\n\r\nSharon van Wyk"

    by the bloggers themselves.<br><br>We asked our editor for his reasons on why
    he approved the post in question &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and to him it seemed rather
    innocuous at the time of approving. It only took on significance after the action
    to fire Kriel. Furthermore our editor himself used to be a sub-editor and for
    him it raised important questions about issues that all newsrooms are facing these
    days in SA.<br><br>Also our editor is not sensitised to the issues between Avusa
    and its employees. He cannot get involved in the specifics involving relationships
    between people and their companies re: what they may or may not do... it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    up to them to police. As Dave said, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s between Llewellyn
    Kriel and Avusa. Frankly, it&#39;s none of our business.<br><br>Another point
    is that I do think this is a new media issue. I agree the blog angle has sensationalised
    this issue, but never-the-less it is still worth talking about and it is interesting
    that it happened via a blog&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; the fact that it happened on
    a competitor platform is probably irrelevant. ie... <br><br>I think this is worth
    talking about, not shutting down the debate..."

  content: Guys, honestly - why bring up sabotage and say you don&#39;t believe it?  Justin
    needs to explain why it&#39;s worth putting it on the agenda if he doesn&#39;t
    believe it - does this mean there are people who do, and on what basis?  This
    is a serious thing to put out there, not something to be said lightly.<br><br>Here
    is an email I sent to Justin on my feelings about this matter and I was planning
    to keep this conversation off-line originally but the more I think about it, the
    more the red herring about sabotage irritates me:<br><br><blockquote><br>"The
    way I see it there are 3 things going on here:<br><br>1. Kriel was fired for breach
    of confidentiality, this is clear to everyone<br><br>The questions it raises are
    the following:<br><br>2. Is the internal working of the media something that can
    be<br>protected by corporate policy or is it more important for the public<br>to
    know?  If you see media strictly as a business then yes, corporate<br>policy can
    dictate what information must be public knowledge.  If, on<br>the other hand,
    you see the media as playing a formative social role -<br>and this is the general
    consensus in terms of media theory - then a<br>situation affecting the way a media
    company produces its product is<br>genuinely in the public interest because it
    affects them directly.  To<br>give you an example, readers of the paper will generally
    use what the<br>paper contains as their own news agenda.  If what the paper says
    is<br>news is being affected by cutbacks and corporate mismanagement then<br>people
    must know that their trusted news source can no longer be<br>trusted.<br><br>3.
    Ignoring the specifics of how Thought Leader works, what this case<br>highlights
    is how much easier personal publishing tools make the<br>violation of corporate
    policy.  This is the new media angle.  Fools<br>like Catto who think they are
    above the law just because they have a<br>blog are just adding noise around this
    issue - the crux is that before<br>blogs you would have to go to a much greater
    effort to reach an<br>audience of a few thousand to tell your secret to - now
    its so easy<br>people could not even realise the consequences until after.<br><br>I
    suppose it was my and Arthur&#39;s choice of headline rather than the<br>actual
    arguments that make you think we&#39;re looking at this thing from<br>one dimension
    only.  My main concern is how media professionals are<br>not questioning the blind
    following of corporate policy, but this is<br>because I come from an academic
    background and see media as being a<br>public service first and a corporate concern
    second, in the bigger<br>scheme of things."  <br></blockquote><br><br>Now, to
    those of you who agree that this can be reduced to the one-dimensional view that
    everything that happens is governed strictly by corporate policy, ask yourselves
    this - is this really your experience of how the world works?  <br><br>The fact
    is that Kriel has a self-acknowledged history of rubbing management up the wrong
    way at the Sowetan and in his previous positions at other papers.  This is actually
    reminiscent of a previous dismissal at another publication.  So obviously this
    is not only about a violation of corporate policy but also about the context in
    which the policy was violated, by whom, and who it affected aside from the company
    as a whole. People all over the place violate corporate policy all the time and
    are not fired for it, they are given a warning.<br><br>Another thing worth asking
    is why Avusa didn&#39;t ask us to take down the post that offended them.  I guess
    it would have been harder to hang Kriel&#39;s head on the city walls if the problem
    went away relatively quietly. <br><br>Needless to say these politics have nothing
    to do with the Mail &amp; Guardian and we weren&#39;t even aware of them when
    this thing went down - Kriel&#39;s comments about the media, insofar as they can
    be generalised, are important because the functioning of the media matters to
    the public.  So to suggest subtly that we&#39;re out to sabotage Avusa seems like
    a smokescreen, as is the focus on Ray&#39;s blog about the extremes of the arguments.
    As an example of a lack of double standard, our print editor has been criticised
    heavily on our own platform - taking criticism is part of the industry we&#39;re
    in, its what makes the media industry robust.<br><br>And seeing as we&#39;re discussing
    this openly I&#39;d like to see which bloggers exactly are saying that blogging
    is above the law, other than Catto, and whether they are representative of the
    whole. I&#39;d also like to know why Justin initially decided not to link to our
    GM&#39;s post that <i>wasn&#39;t</i> critical of Avusa.<br><br>None of this is
    said to damage personal relationships, just to show that there actually is another
    side to this story.

  content: 'Justin makes some valid points and by and large I agree that Kriel effectively
    committed cyber career suicide by venting his frustrations in a public forum.
    He should have known better. But, and here&#39;s the rub, irrespective of his
    lack of foresight, common sense and ability to curb his virtual tongue, the issues
    at the core of his ire should be scrutinised.<br>Once upon a time, I was the Deputy
    Chief Sub Editor of the Pretoria News, considered a good journalist by my peers
    but also something of a loose cannon. I began working for Aunty Argus in the early
    90s, a year or two before she was sold down the river to an Irish bean-canner
    known as O&#39;Reilly. There then followed a ten-year period of steady degradation
    of both the products and morale in the once mighty Argus group which eventually
    led to me producing the capital&#39;s morning paper each night with a total of
    five sub editors (myself included).<br>We too went through a staff morale survey,
    a succession of MDs and jobs freeze. Stress levels were intense and only surpassed
    by the level of griping and moaning of subbing staff who had, on average, more
    than 90 days leave each owing to them due to the fact that for them to take leave
    would have made it impossible to produce the paper.<br>I eventually cracked under
    the pressure, after a particularly hard night, and told my MD what I thought,
    like Kriel, in no uncertain terms in an e-mail which I then copied to heads of
    department at the Pretoria News.<br>I then sent an e-mail to my immediate superior,
    who I thought was my best friend, berating my editor, deputy editor and the impossible
    working conditions. This e-mail somehow found its way into an unmarked envelope
    on the editor&#39;s desk, in spite of being private correspondence.<br>I was disciplined
    and fired. I lost my CCMA case because I should have known better after 20 years
    in the business. Like Kriel, I refused to let go, took the case to the Labour
    Court and lost again.<br>My arguments at the time were Kriel&#39;s arguments.
    E-mail, and the changes it was making to the world of media, was the problematic
    new technology of the moment, just as blogging is the hot potato of today.<br>It
    isn&#39;t comforting to know that the problems I experienced all those years ago
    are still prevalent today. It&#39;s actually a cause for great concern. The print
    media houses of South Africa are living on borrowed time if they think that Kriel&#39;s
    public outburst is an isolated incident.<br>While Justin is correct in his feeling
    that sensitive corporate information should not have been made public on a "rival"
    publication&#39;s site, it is perhaps interesting that the Mail &amp; Guardian
    picked up the pieces of me that Independent Newspapers threw to the floor, taking
    me under its wing as a freelance sub and writer, helping me to establish what
    is now a thriving career as an independent journalist writing what I want, when
    I want, and for who I want.<br>Yes, Avusa was justified in its actions. But consider
    the state of mind of a man, with 30 years experience under his belt, who has been
    driven to the apparent madness which cost him his job and livelihood.<br>Perhaps
    it is time that the big print media moguls in this country looked inwards at the
    men and women who jump through hoops on a daily basis to help them achieve their
    profit margins, in spite of often impossible expectations. Every time a newspaper
    hits the street a team of people has collectively pulled a rabit out of a hat,
    created a silk purse from a sow&#39;s ear and fought the good fight of editorial
    integrity, sometimes in a company whose leaders cannot even spell those two words,
    let alone understand their meaning.<br>Good sub editors are the backbone of the
    print media industry, and they are in short supply - ask any editor. If the press
    is truly to remain free in this country then it needs the experience and expertise
    of people like Kriel, people who have survived the dark days of apartheid and
    who know what this game is all about. Ultimately, what makes a good publication
    is not its profit margin, but the people who work hard to produce it. <br>There
    are some excellent writers in this country, but some would do well to remember
    that it&#39;s a sub who puts their copy on the page, fine tunes it and helps them
    to win the accolades without ever having a byline to say so. It&#39;s a sub who
    sits for hours on a full bladder on deadline hammering out the gremlins in copy,
    thinking up the hard-hitting headlines, the witty standfirsts and eye-grabbing
    pulls, cramming it all above the fold so it can sell the paper on the street,
    getting the job done with little, or no recognition.<br>To Mr Kriel I say this:
    let this go and get on with your life as quickly as you can and hopefully, like
    me, you will realise that the Sowetan has done you the best favour possible by
    setting you free from the shackles of boardroom journalism.<br>To the print media
    of South Africa I say this: rethink the way you do business - your biggest assets
    are your employees. Pay them well, treat them well and remember that they are
    human beings with lives that should not revolve around you. You are not the centre
    of their universe but they are the core of yours.<br><br>Sharon van Wyk'

I've kept relatively quiet about the <a href="http://groogle.co.za/2007/11/30/south-african-newspaper-fires-sub-editor-over-blogging-confidential-company-information-on-opposition-papers-blogging-portal/">recent firing</a> of Llewellyn Kriel but I've just read on <a href="http://mybroadband.co.za/news/Telecoms/2181.html">MyADSL</a> that Kriel plans to appeal the findings of the disciplinary hearing and now I feel I need to take a stand on this issue.
In the article Kriel claims, 
<blockquote>"I am passionate about freedom of expression and I was exercising my constitutional right when I posted the blog."
</blockquote>
He goes on to say that,
<blockquote>"Media in South Africa need to wake up quickly, there is an entirely new face to the media worldwide, influenced by cyberspace."
</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/amablogoblogo/2007/11/30/fired-for-blogging/">Some</a> <a href="http://wiredgecko.net/2007/11/fired-for-blogging-in-south-africa/">other</a> <a href="http://vincentmaher.com/mit/?p=552">bloggers</a> feel quite opinionated about this issue and are all claiming, directly or indirectly, that Kriel was fired because he blogged - not because he broke company policy.
While Kriel may claim he has some constitutional right to <a href="http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/llewellynkriel/2007/11/13/working-on-that-pigs-ear-baby/">say what ever he feels</a> I think we need to look at some of the facts.
1. Kriel is a veteran journalist with more than 30 years experience in the industry. Does this experience not bring with it some common sense when writing about critical operational information in a blog post or do the rules of the <em>real world</em> not apply to a blog or the <em>cyberspace</em>, as he puts it?
2. In order for Kriel to be an employee of the Sowetan (Avusa) he would have had to have signed a contract of employment which would have, in no uncertain terms, contained a clause preventing him from sharing the information he did in the blog post. I know my contract with Avusa prevents me from bringing the company's name into disrepute and also prevents me from sharing operational information with competitors and/or the world.
3. Kriel chose a blog to share his disgruntled views however this doesn't change the fact that he disregarded his contract of employment and in doing so made this a company policy issue - not a blogging issue. The Sowetan's actions where justified and exercised to the fullest and there was nothing wrong with the final decision of giving Kriel the boot.
4. Did Kriel really disclose company information? I think so. For Kriel to even discuss an internal "Climate Survey" conducted for operational purposes is just not on. Avusa is a listed company and as such this post on company morale and the fact that there is a banning of all new appointments can and will have a direct impact on the share price of the company. I'm no stock broker but I do know that share prices are affected by perception and creating this vastly negative impression on the whole of Avusa is gross misconduct. Simple!
5. Taking this to the extreme we also need to look at the possible liability the <a href="http://www.mg.co.za">Mail & Guardian</a> have in this matter. Should Kriel plan to take further legal action what stops Avusa from taking direct action against the M&G for posting the offending blog post in the first place? 
<a href="http://www.thoughtleader.co.za">Thought Leader</a> is a <a href="http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/about-thoughtleader/">strictly moderated</a> website and goes through an editorial work flow before a post or comment goes live on the platform. This means that whether M&G realise it they could become liable for every piece of content on the Thought Leader website and Avusa could argue Kriel's post was a form of industrial sabotage by the competing newspaper.
While I honestly don't believe the M&G did plan any form of sabotage (I know these guys personally!) I do have to question why the post ever made it onto the website in the first place. In my mind, someone should have canned it during the editorial process.
I have to just add that I'm tired of this being a <em>new media</em> issue - it isn't and we all need to get a little perspective. If anything, Kriel's ignorance to <em>the rules of engagement</em> online and his petty rant in a public forum have actually had an adverse effect for blogging in this country. 
His actions have created this moronic impression that you are entitled to say whatever you want to and simply disregard any ethical or contractual obligations you may have because the constitution allows you this right.
As I see it, anyone who still uses the word <em>cyberspace</em> needs to wake up quickly - there is an entirely new dimension to what you're allowed to do online and it's influenced by real world rules.
