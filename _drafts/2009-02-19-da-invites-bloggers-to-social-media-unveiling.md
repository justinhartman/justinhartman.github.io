  content: "If only their politics were as coherent and impressive as their web strategy.\r\n\r\nSadly
    this simply adds another forum for whinging whities to whinge. Social whinging.\r\n\r\nIt's
    also a little too obama-esque for my tastes. In other words, too American and
    a little out of touch with where the market in SA really is at."

    I am really interested to see what they do with Mobile now.\r\n\r\nRyan Coetzee
    highlighted that these sites are just another communication tool and extend their
    current strategy but in the next five years they want to focus more of their efforts
    on their mobile penetration.\r\n\r\nThis, as you will know, is no easy feat and
    if they get it right then I need to sit with their team for some tips."

    there's the politics of the DA, the only party to offer a fully costed manifesto
    complemented with detailed policy proposals for how they would run South Africa.
    All underpinned by a consistent vision which they call the open opportunity society

  content: "Thanks for the link and kudos! \r\n\r\nIt must be said that the DA team
    acknowledged that the digital part of their strategy was, in part, too progressive
    for a broad SA audience, but then they are looking after a very diverse following
    - more so than opposing parties. \r\n\r\nThe various elements within their overall
    strategy have to cater for very different demographic profiles - and I commend
    the DA for trying not to alienate any of them. \r\n\r\nFor example, I think the
    social networking stuff may not be as pervasive with the broader populace, but
    they're looking after a niche group that can become very important and vocal ambassadors
    for the party. With regards to the lower income groups, that's where the canvassing,
    advertising and mobile strategy comes in.\r\n\r\nPersonally (although I'm obviously
    a little biased), I think they're bang on with their approach. \r\n\r\nThe question
    they asked is: \"Can we afford NOT to be progressive?\"\r\n\r\nAs for the influence
    from Obama, it would be dumb not to take some inspiration from the most successful
    digital marketing campaign in history. But as Coetzee said yesterday, there are
    some innovations that they're rolling out to build upon Obama's example."

    these cries of \"copy cat\" - get over it people. There's so little authenticity
    in the world these days - and there's nothing wrong with borrowing from what's
    worked for others. Why reinvent the wheel? \r\n\r\nJarred, I think you are selling
    South Africa short by implying that this approach is out of touch. I am sure that
    the DA will be using all the traditional channels in addition to an online strategy
    to ensure that as many people as possible are informed and updated."

<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/02/img_3875-500x332.jpg" alt="img_3875" title="img_3875" width="500" height="332" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-594" />
The <a href="http://www.da.org.za">Democratic Alliance</a> today unveiled their new social media strategy to a small audience in Cape Town comprising journalists, party members and, believe it or not, bloggers. I was one of the lucky ones to crack an invite yesterday afternoon and I have to admit I was extremely excited to hear what the DA had up their sleeves.
Cape Town City Mayor and DA Leader, <a href="http://twitter.com/helenzille">Helen Zille</a> gave the first speech highlighting the DA's progressive and forward thinking strategy. Mayor Zille said that,
<blockquote>this new digital strategy will reach South African voters in exciting and groundbreaking ways. Our approach is to build a personalised relationship with the DA's supporters by involving them in our activities and campaigns.
</blockquote>
The speech was followed by another from DA CEO Ryan Coetzee and he took us through the elements of the new communication strategy. This new strategy includes some of the following:
<ul>
<li>Two Interactive websites</li>
<li>Online advertising and marketing</li>
<li>SMS communication</li>
<li>Mobile web access</li>
<li>Engagement with voters via social networking and in the blogosphere</li>
</ul>
<strong>New DA website launched</strong>
Then the two new websites were unveiled. The first was the DA's main website <a href="http://www.da.org.za">www.da.org.za</a> which has seen a major facelift and integration with various forms of Social Media. Some of this include videos embedded via <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> and <a href="http://multimedia.thetimes.co.za">Times Multimedia</a>, a new forum component and various other social tools for sharing information. It's cutting edge, usable and really puts the pressure on the other political parties. A job well done.
<a href="http://www.da.org.za"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/02/picture-8-500x299.png" alt="picture-8" title="picture-8" width="500" height="299" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-595" /></a>
<strong>Contribute To Change</strong>
The new <a href="http://contributetochange.org.za">contribute to change website</a> is equally impressive at first glance. The core of the website is to allow people the freedom to bring upon change in our country and the site has a strong social networking aspect to it that facilitates this process. In addition to the social networking you can pledge your support to making a change in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Build a team by recruiting your friends.</li>
<li>Spread the word by sending letters to all the major newspapers and talk shows.</li>
<li>Attend or host a DA event.</li>
<li>Make phone calls and reach out to voters.</li>
<li>Go door to door.</li>
<li>Donate some cash.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://contributetochange.org.za"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/02/picture-9-500x286.png" alt="picture-9" title="picture-9" width="500" height="286" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-596" /></a>
Each of these allow individuals to take action and contribute to change as Helen puts it. I noted that while this website was extremely well put together I worried about what the value proposition was for end users and laymen like you and I. My first impression of the site was that this is very heavily directed to helping the DA and while this is positive I struggled to see how this benefited consumers - in other words, what were the DA doing for us in return.
For those who have heard Helen Zille speak you'll know that she delivers a convincing and strong message and she was very quick to answer my concerns. The whole aim of the DA is to ultimately shift focus on opposition toward the focus on our country and how we as citizens could help make a difference. While I do respect this and it was a convincing argument I am still concerned that an ANC or COPE supporter wouldn't use this website as it's too heavily focused on the DA.
I wanted to ask, but thought not to at the time, whether or not the DA had given any thoughts to making this website agnostic - similar I guess to the new <a href="http://saelections.co.za">SA Elections</a> website - as this could really bring the whole country together and not just DA supporters. If the Contribute To Change website was powered by the DA yet remained in the background I think this website could be far more successful in the long term.
What has really impressed me though is that the DA are by far the most progressive political party in South Africa. The ANC's attempts at social media have been dismal and these two new sites by the DA really highlight their commitment to long term change in our country.
Both the new DA and Contribute To Change websites are built off open-source technology, specifically <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://bbpress.org/">BBPress</a> and <a href="http://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress</a>, and it's great to see the use of open-source to drive the DA's campaign.
I have to commend the DA, their <a href="http://lsdev.biz/">web development team</a> and the guys running the social media strategy behind the scenes on a job well done. I'm only worried that the Contribute To Change website is a little <em>too advanced</em> for a South African audience but only time will tell.
