    one of the largest web 'products' to come out of South Africa. I have a funny
    feeling that Adgator will be the same.\r\n\r\nCongrats!"

    is a winner.  Keep up the momentum - you guys are going places!\r\n\r\nWaiting
    for you guys to seal a deal with an airline or a bus company (e.g. Translux) and
    then I'll be giving adgator a lot of business."

<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a> loves us! <strong>WOW</strong>. I know the last few posts of mine have been about gloating but when ReadWriteWeb features us in their Top 10 lists who can resist?
This time, RRW has given <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> an honourable mention in the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_rsssyndication_products_of_2008.php">Top 10 RSS and Syndication Products of 2008</a> list.
This Top 10 list features <a href="http://friendfeed.com">FriendFeed</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twitterfeed</a>, <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> and <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Pipes</a>. Here's what RRW had to say about us.
<blockquote>Finally, we love African social media aggregator Afrigator - it's a great way to learn about what's happening all over the continent and it's a great use of RSS. We named it one of the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_international_products_2008.php">Top 10 International Products of 2008</a> but we think it deserves an honorable mention in this category as well.
</blockquote>
Once again I'm humbled by RRW's support of Afrigator and it's a great way to end off a fantastic year for us!
