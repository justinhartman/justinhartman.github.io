I submitted my vote on <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/sport/news.aspx?id=118989">sports poll</a> this morning and noticed a shocking figure in the results.
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/08/picture-1.png' alt='The Times Sports Poll' />
Now I know I'm largely in the minority here but I honestly believe that <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/index.asp">Arsenal</a> have a great chance of winning the league this season. While British press and football pundits have written off Arsenal's hopes of lifting the title I have no doubt we're going to be contenders.
It makes me sick to listen to "the experts" talk about how Arsenal are going through a <em>transitional</em> period in our history as this is simply not the case. Seemingly if you bring in a whole string of young, talented players to a big Premiership club you're immediately cast into the "transition" category and any chance of winning is left to the other big clubs.
Arsenal have had an amazing pre-season warmup and winning the Emirates Cup as well as the Amsterdam Tournament, against some very heavy opposition is surely a show of our character? And yes, even despite the loss of legendary Arsenal skipper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry">Thierry Henry</a> we managed to came back on Sunday in the final 10 minutes of the game to seal a very important victory against <a href="http://www.fulhamfc.com/home.aspx">Fulham</a>.
As our newly appointed captain, <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/player.asp?thisNav=first+team&plid=66633&clid=4421&cpid=703">William Gallas</a> says:
<blockquote>Last year was not easy because we had too many injuries but this season everything has changed. And I can tell you it changed in pre-season - how the players train, how they fight on the pitch - and when I saw that I said 'we will do something' this season.
</blockquote>
While we may not be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincibles_%28football%29">The Invincibles</a> any longer I think it's naive of the public to simply discount this very experienced and motivated side.
