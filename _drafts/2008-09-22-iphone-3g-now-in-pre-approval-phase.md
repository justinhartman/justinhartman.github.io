  content: Yeah they only went into pre-approval phase yesterday but it's apparently
    going to be here on Friday. I doubt it. My guess is that they'll now try and filter
    out the rubbish candidates and build up a list of people that can afford the heavily
    priced package.

Just got this email from Vodacom about the imminent launch of the 3G iPhone. I spoke to Apple earlier today and it is confirmed that the iPhone will launch this week in South Africa - just not exactly sure of the date yet.
Based on the email below it looks like you now get a chance to be pre-approved which means they will now credit check you and if you qualify then they'll offer you a massive package. Anyway, I've applied. Let's see what happens.
