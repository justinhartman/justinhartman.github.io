  content: "You are a brave man I must admit. I am most definitely not intending to
    blog about this until I have a firm grasp on the facts, which is why I applaud
    you attempt here, you have a great grasp of stats and facts. \r\n\r\nI 100% concur
    that our government should put up or shut up. What the bloody hell do we have
    to gain from pointing fingers at other when we are blindfolded to master bob's
    repulsive actions and unjustifiable human rights violations in Zim. \r\n\r\nSpot
    on in that regard. \r\n\r\nI am reluctant to blog about this in much the same
    way as I have always been reluctant to discuss Turkey/Cyprus and the issues involved
    there. It's a long battle that not many people truly grasp outside of the borders
    involved in the issues. There are deep-seated issues that exist that I just don't
    understand and therefore will not willingly put my foot forward in either direction.
    But that's just me. \r\n\r\nThe one thing I know is that innocents, children,
    woman and men who do not deserve the atrocities are always the ones affected the
    most. And the best we can do as way of explanation in these situations is \"Collateral
    damage\" - what a disgusting turn of phrase."

    this complaint that the Israelis are injuring civilians, well that is exactly
    what Hamas has intended all along and why it launches its attacks on Israel from
    within one of the most densely populated areas in the world.  It is cowardly terrorism.
    \ \r\n\r\nHamas wants images of dead Palestinian children on TV.  I just don't
    understand why these protesters don't see that.  Where were the protest marches
    all those years Hamas was firing rockets into Israel anyway?"

  content: "Let me first state that I do not back Hamas or Israel as both sides are
    targeting and killing innocent people. \r\n\r\nYour blog post is extremely one
    sided and omits the all important question as to why Hamas  are acting the way
    they are? \r\n\r\nHamas are not just firing rockets for the sake of it, there
    is obviously a motivation behind their actions. I suggest you read up on the history
    of this conflict not just going back 2/3 years but since it all started to understand
    why. You can start with this first hand account of what the occupation is like
    http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/ci_11409100 and see just what is driving these people
    to do what they do. Its apartheid all over and has been deemed illegal http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/2411.htm.
    This probably explains why the ANC has come out and said what they have.\r\n\r\nAnother
    few points about your post:\r\n\r\nIt is not a \"small quota of militant Palestinian
    militia\" it is Hamas, who have been democratically elected to government \r\n\r\nThe
    cease fire was broken by Isreal, not Hamas http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KntmpoRXFX4"

  content: "@Scott - my blog post is intentionally one side because I'm trying to
    highlight why I feel Israel were warranted in protecting their people. I'm also
    stating that I'm undecided as to whether or not the force in which they are protecting
    their people is warranted but I understand why they're doing it.\r\n\r\nHamas
    is technically a political party but their mandate is to recapture the State of
    Israel for Palestine and since 1987 they have been inflicting suicide and other
    attacks on Israeli civilians and security forces. The fact that they are democratically
    elected points to the problem that Muslim extremists now run a largely peaceful
    and oppressed people.\r\n\r\nIf you look at history this all points to a faction
    of Palestinians who, since the Six-Day war, have had a problem with Israeli rule
    over the promised land. This entire conflict stems from a disagreement of who
    \"really\" owns the land and hence why this conflict will never be resolved in
    my opinion."

  content: "Talking about Hamas representing the Palestinians is so far from the reality.
    See this movie from a Palestinian (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_OGhj43GAE).
    Hamas is a terror organization based on a very extreme Muslims ideas backed by
    Iran. There can't be any base of talking between Hamas and Israel as Hamas
    is not talking on freeing the \"occupied\" territories but Hamas philosophy and
    ideas (which he mentioned time after time) is to destroyed Israel and kill Jews.
    Two years ago Hamas took over the Gaza strip from the Phatach (ruling Palestinian
    organization) by killing hundred of Phatach people and their supporters. Killing
    other Palestinians!!!!!  The Arab world should support Israel in their war against
    the Hamas which will save the Palestinians from brutal terrorist organization.
    During the last years after Israel moved out of Gaza, Hamas instead of taking
    care of the population by buildings schools, hospitals and create a place which
    people can live in, was busy smuggling weapons and building his power. This is
    what Hamas understand. It does not know how to build a society. It is a terrorist
    organization. \r\nHamas is using children as a human shield, hiding and shooting
    beyond them waiting for the IDF to kill civilians and than show the world how
    cruel is Israel.\r\nDuring the past 8 years Hamas was firing rockets on Israel.
    8 years!! Which country in the world would agree to that? Why not many civilians
    where killed? Because Israel are protecting their civilians by building shelters
    and secure areas. The world should wake up and understand that Israel is in the
    front line against terrorism and the extreme Islam around the world. It should
    be supported as the extremist will continue to Europe (already started) and the
    rest of the world. \r\nFor the children who are being killed in Gaza, it is a
    trouble and unnecessary outcome of the cruelty of Hamas militant, firing rockets
    and bombs from schools and public buildings, forcing the IDF to shoot and those
    buildings which hundred of civilians are inside. Shocking!!\r\ntwisted to the
    extremest."

  content: "Thankyou for posting this, Justin. It takes courage!\r\nCouple of points:\r\n1.
    Hamas is internationally seen to be a terror organisation, whether elected or
    not.\r\n2. Their mandate is to wipe Israel out - permanently.\r\n3. As some of
    your respondents have said, they routinely place their missile launchers, bomb-making
    factories etc. in the homes, hospitals and universities , among the civilians.
    Pictures of dead and dying women and children make good PR and gain them sympathy
    round the world. \r\n4. Their leaders have openly confessed that they have a culture
    of death, whereas Israelis have a culture of life.\r\n5. How many people are aware
    of the fact that the IDF made thousands of cellphone calls to the citizens of
    Gaza, as well as dropping planeloads of leaflets, all warning the population to
    evacuate before they went in to strike at the terrorists? How many other armed
    forces do you know who do that?\r\n6. Wounded Gazans are being treated in Israeli
    hospitals.\r\n7.The entire Jewish community of Gaza left in 2005 so the \"Palestinians\"
    could move in. And immediately the whole area was turned into a staging ground
    for bombing Israel - 6000 rockets in 3 years, all aimed at Israeli civilians-
    homes, schools and kindergartens. There are small children who spent most of that
    time in bomb shelters, terrorstricken.\r\n\r\nI could go on. This foretaste is
    for those who said they needed more info on the situation. \r\nTry this blog,
    written by a South African journo living in Jerusalem - one who grew up under
    apartheid and fought it with everything he could; and was a card carrying ANC
    member.\r\nwww.stangoodenough.com\r\nHere's an interesting story:\r\nIDF unveils
    Hamas map.\r\nhttp://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1231424893023"

    10 Israelis killed in the recent conflict vs 700 Palestinians - It has to be a
    realistic response.\r\n\r\nSecondly it is very easy for Israel to be the playground
    bully as long as the US is happy to condone their actions in the UN / political
    arena...  If the US wasn't backing them they wouldn't be so quick to cross foreign
    borders to start wars.\r\n\r\nA more moderate stance from the US would go a long
    way to a more moderate Israel in my humble opinion"

    it is sad, but it is something that is necessary. Peace I dont feel is going to

    if Israel did not take that kind of stance, they would not be able to deal with
    Hama's. I feel sorry for the people, but in order to have peace, I believe that
    there sometimes has to be suffering. What makes 2009 so much more special than
    any other year in history, I think its not, and I think that people need to stop
    pointing fingers at Israel and the blame needs to be placed smack bang on Hama's.

    by supporting Israel you are justifying the killing of civilians. That is what
    Israel is doing. I am not against the use of military power, and  I am not against
    acts against Hamas. But what Israel is doing now is FAR over the line of anything
    near acceptable. \r\n\r\nIsrael is not trying to work with Hamas to get an solution,
    Israel is working against Hamas to get THEIR solution. Both solutions are bad,
    and until one or both of the parties acknowledges that, peace will not be in order
    no matter how many bombs Israel use on civilians."

  content: I quote something from one of my blog posts "For months, Hamas thugs in
    Gaza have fired missiles and mortars into southern Israel, subjecting hundreds
    of thousands of Israelis to a campaign of 24-hour terror. This was done in clear
    violation of an Egyptian-negotiated cease-fire to which Hamas had agreed. Hamas
    ended the truce even against the wishes of some Muslim heads of state. Then after
    pounding Israel for a week, and after Israel warned it would respond" and "And,
    just as night follows day, each time Israel responds with force, it is condemned
    for its &ldquo;disproportionate response.&rdquo; This time around, more than 300
    Palestinians have been killed, against four Israelis. But here's why. Gaza
    is one of the most densely populated areas of the world, and Hamas is infamous
    for hiding among its constituents, using them as human shields. Weapons are being
    stored in mosques. The only university in Gaza has turned its labs over to the
    terrorists, who are using them to make bombs and mortars. These cowards intentionally
    set up their bases near schools and hospitals to maximize the number of casualties
    to gain sympathy in the media." and "Gaza, in recent years, has been turned into
    &ldquo;Gazastan,&rdquo; an Islamic republic that educates its own children to
    seek death in martyrdom operations. Gaza TV airs children's shows that teach
    six and seven year-olds to kill Jews."

  content: "Well.. I must say I strongly disagree with your biased opinion which practically
    justifies what Israel is doing in Gaza. \r\n\r\nJust a question? How would you
    like for a group of people to come and occupy your country? Wont you ressist by
    any chance? Is it what the Israeli doing to the Palestinians, fair? Answer me
    please. I hope one of you still has some sort of guiding principles. \r\n\r\nYour
    a bit naive, telling people that Hamas are firing rockets to distrupt peace in
    the middle east. \r\n\r\nI will tell you why Hamas was firing their rockets at
    Israel. Two years ago, the Palestinian elected Hamas as their representors. The
    trouble all begins when Israel declares Hamas as group of terrorists, and then
    Hamas call the occupnist (in that case Israel) an inproper country.\r\n\r\nAs
    a result Israel decides to besiege Gaza. For two years Gaza was besieged, the
    borders were closed, Egypt even closed its borders. No food, No gas for water
    and electricity came to Gaza. A humiterean crisis was bound to the Gazains. And
    I will come to telling you why Hamas was firing those rockets over to Israel.\r\n\r\nSo
    Hamas wanted to take action, and the only action they could of had taken is to
    fire rocket over to Israel. \r\n\r\nIf Israel broke the siege then Hamas would
    stop. Simple aye?\r\n\r\nThis war is unfair, the Palestinians suffered alot, to
    the Israels our blood is nothing. \r\n\r\nPlus, what logic are you guys using
    condeming Hamas for the death of the Palestinian children?!?!? Israel is attacking
    has bombed every inch of 10km X 40km Gaza which is home 1.5 million humans. Please!
    Israel are terrorists, the TV should prove that to you.\r\n\r\nThe cartoon should
    of had the Hamas militant tell the Israel: \"If you and your allies (Egypt) open
    the border allowing matter to go back to the norm, I will not poke you.\" And
    the Israeli saying \"If you evacuate your home, and leave your country to me,
    I wont punch you.\"\r\n\r\nWhats now going on in Gaza is a holocaust targetting
    the Palestinian. I on my behalf intiate all of you to condemn Israel for its terrorist
    actions.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunaltly, people lost all their sense of guiding principles,
    we live in a relation built world"

  content: "Justin, you are entitled to your opinion and thanks for sharing it. However
    i must say the post above just shows your lack of knowledge on Middle eastern
    politics. Some of the sites you are reading seem to be hasbara websites (propaganda),
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbara by Israeli government agencies.  Secondly,
    the figures may be true, but why no mention of the Palestinian deaths since then(Mostly
    civillian) ? Would that show a totally different picture? 6000+ deaths since 2000.
    For the last 8 years there have been raids done by the every single month killing
    people. Have a look at the palestinian human rights monitoring group. \r\n(http://www.phrmg.org/aqsa/fatalities_list.htm)\r\n\r\n
    This conflict has been going on for decades, before you or i were even born. \r\n\r\nBut
    take the current conflict in context, and forget everything before. 2 Years ago,
    Hamas was elected in a free and fair election to be the leaders of the Palestinian
    authority. \r\n\r\nWhat did the west (US,UK &amp; Israel) do? Instead of engaging
    with them, they tried to stage a coup. Put their man Abas in power, supporting
    Fatah in overthrowing the ELECTED party.\r\nThis didnt work, and Hamas expelled
    all fatha members. Since then the entire Gaza strip has been in a blockade, air,
    sea and borders with other countries.\r\n\r\nYour statement \"We are easy to forget
    history\" totally leaves out the Palestinian casualties. A point proving ignorance
    in the history of this particular conflict. But lets get back on point.\r\n\r\nThe
    naval, air and blockade of the borders has been designed to STARVE the people
    of GAZA, to create a humanitarian crisis so the PEOPLE of GAZA revolt against
    hamas. This particular operation \"Cast &amp; Lead\" was planned as far back as
    January/Feb last year (As confirmed by Israeli news sources, ill try and dig up
    the link)\r\n\r\n6 Months ago, Both Hamas and israel agreed to a 6 month cease
    fire. The conditions of the Cease fire were, no rocket attacks from Hamas. In
    exchange Israel would Open up the borders, and not conduct further raids/killings
    in Gaza.\r\n\r\nHere's the most important part, As confirmed by CNN and many other
    News media agencies, in the middle of November Israel conducted raids on Gaza
    killing a few people. This was widely reported(i.e Israel broke the cease fire),
    also during this time the borders were never opened. Hence when the 19th of December
    came about Hamas chose NOT to renew the cease fire. Since Israel was not holding
    up to their end. Hamas have repeatedly made it known they are willing to agree
    to cease fires lasting decades, on condition the people of palestine live FREE
    as in free like you and i. Free in that food, medical supplies and aid can come
    into the country. Free as in the government that the people have chosen in a DEMOCRATIC
    election, is allowed to govern."

    It would be interesting to see some stats from both sides of this conflict. \r\n\r\nBe
    that as it may: The Palestinian people have a legitimate claim to their land.
    As far as I can see, Israel's right to existence is particularly suspect. A bunch
    of Western governments simply decided to take an occupied territory and move the
    locals out of it in order to make way for a state to cater that is based on race
    and religion. (See this article of the Israel - Apartheid Analogy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_apartheid
    )\r\n\r\nNonetheless, there is no denying that Hamas is a cowardly terrorist organisation
    and that their tactics will achieve nothing in order to help the Palestinian people.
    \r\n\r\nIt is a shame that there has been no Palestinian Nelson Mandela or Mahatma
    Gandhi. My message to the Palestinian people: Learn from Gandhi and Mandela. Stop
    Hating. You cannot fight fire with fire, but only with water. \r\n \r\nMy message
    to the Israelis: Democracy is the only way to peace. Yes, you probably will be
    outnumbered by Palestinians in your parliament before too long, but you'll find
    that this is not the end of the world, just the end of a state based on race &amp;
    religion. And it's not that bad. We're doing fine here in South Africa."

    Interestingly the US themselves removed HAMAS from the official terrorist list

    suicide attacks (I cant speak here as i dont know of any that hamas have claimed)
    Though i do know they agreed with Fatah Many years ago that for them to achieve

    (and a lot of other people in South Africa) - well done for that.\r\n\r\nThe core
    of your arguments is: \"The critical point here is that despite a ceasefire militants
    continued their onslaught and in my mind it is impossible for any country, not
    just Israel, to continue avoiding attacks on your people when a handful of extremists
    keep disregarding the peace.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, since the ceasefire agreement on
    19 June 2008 the rockets, the rockets (at least initially) were in response to
    Israeli aggression and at first condemned by Hamas:\r\n- on 24 June 2008 Israel
    raided Nablus, and rockets were fired into Israel by Islamic Jihad (Hamas condemned
    the rocket attacks).\r\n- On 4 Nov Israel raided Gaza killing 6 Hamas members,
    which Hamas claimed was a massive breach of the truce, whereafter this is when
    rocket attacks increased sharply.\r\n\r\nYou've been brave to put your point of
    view forward and I commend you for that.  I also encourage others to study the
    facts and state their opinions as boldly as you have - this leads to more knowledge
    and insight about the situation."

  content: "Captonian - thanks for your comment. My only point with this post was
    in fact to give a different perspective to things which I think it has achieved.\r\n\r\nJust
    in terms of the ceasefire issue. I'm am really of the opinion that we will truly
    not know the exact circumstances. CNN claim Israel is to blame, other sources
    say Hamas is to blame.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mitchell Bard, a foreign policy analyst
    who lectures frequently on U.S. Middle East policy has stated that in fact Israel
    is not to blame for breaking the ceasefire. He says:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>On June
    17, 2008, after several months of indirect contacts between Israel and Hamas through
    Egyptian mediators, Hamas agreed to a cease-fire (tahadiya). Almost immediately
    afterward, terrorists fired rockets into southern Israel. Despite what it called
    a &ldquo;gross violation&rdquo; of the truce, Israel refrained from military action.
    In fact, during the six months the arrangement was supposed to be observed, 329
    rockets and mortar shells were fired at Israel.\r\n\r\n While there were considerably
    fewer Palestinian assaults after the agreement than before, terror continued.
    Nevertheless, the IDF did not respond to the provocations. On the contrary, Israel
    significantly increased the amount of goods delivered to the Gaza Strip.\r\n\r\nDuring
    this period, Israel also expected to negotiate the release of Gilad Shalit, the
    Israeli soldier taken hostage by Hamas in June 2006. The group repeatedly increased
    its demands for the number of prisoners it wanted released in exchange for the
    lone Israeli captive, but never agreed to grant his freedom.\r\n\r\nViolence escalated
    in early November after the IDF carried out a military operation close to the
    border security fence on the Gazan side that killed seven Hamas terrorists. Israel
    acted after discovering that Hamas had dug a tunnel under the fence and planned
    to abduct more Israeli soldiers. Hamas responded by shelling Israeli towns and
    has continued the rocket barrage ever since.\r\n\r\nWhen the Hamas-imposed six-month
    deadline expired in December, Israel hoped an agreement could be reached to extend
    the cease-fire. Instead, Hamas began firing what would be hundreds of rockets
    into Israel.\r\n\r\nWhen the bombardment began, it became apparent Hamas had used
    the lull to upgrade its arsenal with weapons that were too sophisticated to have
    been designed or built in Gaza. These advanced Qassam and Grad rockets, which
    have placed 1 in every 8 Israelis in mortal danger, originated in Iran. They were
    smuggled into Gaza in pieces, assembled, and fired from launch pads well-hidden
    and shielded in Palestinian population centers.\r\n\r\nOnce launched, hundreds
    of thousands of Israelis have as little as fifteen seconds to reach a bunker before
    a rocket detonates. Hamas has turned all of southern Israel into a place that
    more resembles a post-apocalyptic world, rather than a modern, civilized society.
    Imagine never being able to step outside without remaining in sprinting distance
    of a concrete bunker. Imagine having to dive into the safety of a bunker 30 times
    a day, everyday. Try to imagine the terror of the rocket whistling down, not knowing
    whether it will land a mile a way, or directly above your head. Can you imagine
    the sudden shock when you feel the impact, the relief that overcomes you that
    you are still alive and the immediate sorrow and concern that follows when you
    realize that others like - your family and friends - may not have
    been so lucky this time?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe only point with this is that
    we can debate who broke the ceasefire all year however everyone is an expert and
    everyone has a different perspective. This IMHO is open to various different interpretations
    that none of us will agree on."

    own personal perspective is undecided.\r\n\r\nI hate the fact that hundreds of
    innocent people are dying every day and it does not sit well with me - doesn't
    matter who's to blame here! My only hope is that it all ends sooner rather than
    later - for everyone's sake!!!"

    of yours would cause such a massive posting. Debate is important, good job in
    making one.\r\n\r\nOn topic: You say that you totally understand Israel. I do
    that to! Most people (err, at least many) do. But of course you understand Hamas
    as well. They've hated Israel their whole life, why would they stop now? What
    should they do instead, become shepherds?\r\n\r\nBut understanding and agreeing
    is two way different points. I understand that Israel wants to defend themselves
    and stop Hamas, but I do not in any way agree in the bombings of civilians.\r\n\r\nBombing
    civilians in another country does not count for as to \"protect themselves\",
    no matter how people twist and turn on it. If someone is going to attack another
    country, it should be the UN, and noone else.\r\n\r\n@carls\r\n\r\nActually, I
    think we are close to peace there. Give it 20 years and I think we have it. As
    education and technology goes up, people will drop all the mindless war-things.
    But I might be a bit too optimistic. Time will tell :-)"

  content: "Well to answer Nafisa question regarding why some of the Arab nations
    have done nothing about the current crisis. \r\n\r\nThe answer to this is simple,
    they simply lack Arab nationalism, apart from Qatar, and Syria, they are all simply
    leaders of corrupted governments, and traitors to the Palestinian cause.\r\n\r\nTo
    us Arab, we dont want Hosni Muburak and the likes of him (Al Saud) as our leader
    to us. They dont even represent us, they represent those who fund them and ensure
    them their kingdom. \r\n\r\nThe Arabian street fully recognized Hamas as a NON
    terrorist movement, they fund it, follow it, and protest for it. Let me make it
    simple, look at it this way: The every day Arab - is for Hamas and anti Israel.
    (We want Al Quds and the 'stolen' Palestnian state back\"\r\n\r\nThe odd Arab
    leader would simply stand with Israel and America, as they are the one who'd protect
    his seats.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, most of the Arabs have turned there loyalty
    to Iran, whom seems to have the will to fight back at Israel. Iran can simply
    dominate the Arab world sooner or later, everyone here is in support of them and
    their policy regarding Israel. \r\n\r\nAnd back to you Noel, there will be peace
    as long as Israel is here. They took our lands, and we want them back, simple?
    Europe threw its garbage at us, by sending us those Zionists. We want Europe to
    come clean the garbage here. \r\n\r\nPlease.. take the jew back from were he came
    from 50 years ago."

  content: "@justin: The quote you posted seems like that particular analyst has been
    well trained in the art of Hasbara (Govt Sponsored) Israeli propaganda. Re-read
    it again, i have seen training programmes for propaganda like this. Examples are
    never refer to someone as an 'Activist' or freedom fighter. Brand them terrorists
    (Irrespective if it may be true or not) or better yet, when reporting on Anti-War
    protests, dont call it a protest... It's a RIOT. \r\n\r\nThe description at the
    end is the best though. Lets look at the facts, Israel: F16, Tanks, Precision
    bombs, the best weapons. vs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qassam_rocket , Made
    in a similar way that they make things like fireworks. Using common fertalizers
    etc. Nowhere is the palestinian cause mentioned of the constant fear and bombing,
    raids etc. \r\n\r\nAn yes, there are UN international laws against Excessive Force
    / Disapproriate force / collective punishment. Which Israel is guilty of. \r\n\r\nIn
    addition, Israel have totally ignored tons of UN resolutions, i.e cease occupying
    pre1967 borders. Fact is To this day israel is an occupying force, millions of
    people have been displaced for Decades. Millions of people are refugees for decades,
    legally regarded by the UN as refugees that originally inhabited what is now modern
    day Israel. \r\n\r\nThe political leaders of Hamas have repeatedly announced their
    intentions of a long term cease fire and peace deal \r\n\"On 13 February 2006,
    in an interview in Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta,[39] Mashal again held
    up the possibility of \"a long-term truce with Israel\" if Israel recognized the
    1949 armistice lines, withdraw itself from all Palestinian territories (including
    the West Bank and East Jerusalem) and recognized Palestinian rights that would
    include the \"right of return\". He reaffirmed this stance in a 5 March 2008 interview
    with Al Jazeera English\"\r\n\r\n@nafisa agreed, the miltary wing may be regarded
    as terrorists however the Hamas Political Arm, is different and were elected.
    During the elections, they made it clear they were willing for a long term cease
    fire with israel on condition Israel would cease occupying, Also the previous
    mantra in which israel was not recognized was not even part of the manifesto.
    \r\n\r\nRemember, Umkhonto we Sizwe was founded by Nelson Mandela. Responsible
    for a number of bombings between 60's and 80's, they were also regarded as a 'Terrorist'
    org. In 94, he was elected to the presidency and was responsible for SA's transformation.
    i.e His view changed from that of 'Violence being the answer' to that of reconciliation.
    Point being Hamas as an ORG was democratically elected, and when they start saying
    would like to discuss solutions. What is the response? Starve, block all borders,
    restrict movements and support rival parties in an uprising. \r\n\r\n???? uh...
    WTF? \r\n\r\nRead this\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/this-is-like-%20apartheid-anc-veterans-visit-west-bank-865063.html\r\n\r\nWhat

    Any native people&hellip;view their country as their national home&hellip; They
    will not voluntarily allow, not only a new master, but even a new partner&hellip;
    Colonization can have only one goal. For the Palestinian Arabs this goal is inadmissible.
    This is in the nature of things. To change that nature is impossible&hellip; colonization
    can, therefore, continue and develop only under the protection of a force independent
    of the local population - an iron wall which the native population cannot break
    through. This is, in toto, our policy towards the Arabs. To formulate it any other
    way would only be hypocrisy."

    pick a side, since both sides are bad. Israel wants to bulldoze palestine, Palestine
    pretty much want to bulldoze back. Either way, someone loose. This isn't right,
    and it is important that the rest of the world to try explain that to them. If
    we condemn the use of violence in the area, and manages to get rid of it, then
    we are a lot closer to an agreement. But the US pretty much decides now. As long
    as US backs Israel, I think they can do whatever they want. The Arab world will
    most likely continue to support Hamas because of religion and lack of knowledge,
    so I think the EU and the rest should be very clear about not taking side, but
    condamning the way both sides act now. Especially on civilians.\r\n\r\n@Justin\r\n\r\nSorry

    I suspect that Israel knew this from the beginning and the outcome that they/the
    US are looking for is that Iran is provoked enough to do something so that they
    can retaliate and destroy the remaining Muslim country without a puppet leadership.

  content: "@ Justin's \"The only way for Israel to prevent this from happening is

    at all. I also don't agree with what Israel is doing, but it is justified in my
    opinion.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it will result in success (whatever that may be)
    is also debatable - We all know that killing militants or civilians is only going
    to harbor more anger towards Israel resulting in future attacks.\r\n\r\nTo go
    a little off-topic here, I am trying to understand the arab/Israeli battle over
    land.\r\n\r\nI have visited Israel, and I must say it's miles ahead of many destinations
    (london, new york, sydney, etc) in terms of technology, infrastructure, education,security
    and financial stability.\r\n\r\nIt was a deset roughly 60 years ago and the Israeli's
    have turning it around. They are content with their state - I can't understand
    why the Arabs aren't content with the land that they have which is probably 1000
    times the size with massive natural resources.\r\n\r\nYet in 100's of years they
    are barely scraping by as third-world countries and continue to direct their energy
    everywhere accept productivity. If Hammas spent half the time, effort and strategy
    on building rockets on schools, educational infrastructure and civil requirements,
    palestine could thrive, be independent, have an economy and co-exist with Israel.
    Israel welcomes this but is almost forced to take measures into their own hands
    when Palestinian leaders can't control their own people and militant groups.\r\n\r\nDid
    anyone see that senior Palestinian negotiator an AlJazeera last night??? What
    a muppet!!! I've seen Grade 5 students debate and formulate sentences better..."

    have lots of other options than to bomb civilians. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have
    another though. Very unrealistic and hypothetical, but still: \r\n\r\nWhat if
    Israel backed out of Gaza, told Hamas they were sorry and maybe gave them back
    some land or something as a sign to show that Israel now are willing to cooperate.
    Maybe tare down some walls as well. I don't think that would change much, it might
    lead to more violence against israelis but what if they from that point on, always
    treated Hamas with respect and was humble to them, always agreeing on peace, maybe
    give up tiny parts of land and not condamning them at all, even though Hamas kept
    sending rockets at them. Also offer trade and charity at all times.\r\n\r\nIf
    they kept this good-faith in Hamas for a long time, without ever doing any harm
    to them and always showed willingness to cooporate. Would Hamas still gain support
    from its people and the arab world when Israel does nothing to provoke them and
    is only being good to them?"

  content: "It is completly crazy read that people base their opinion only by relying
    on the number of deaths from each side . While in the past hamas didn't have enough
    rockets,they were blowing up  buses and cars to kill Israelis. Now, Hamas has
    more sophisticated rockets (Iranian, chinese ones not only \"made in Gaza\") than
    before which allow them to target Israel from far- Hamas is also using schools,
    mosques and buildings with civilian as warehouse. The buildings targeted by Israel
    are the one from which Hamas lauch their rockets or where Hamas tunnels are located
    ( thousand of Kilometers of tunnels!!!!!!! 900-1000 tunnels according to the Egyptians).\r\nIsrael
    punishes the intentions of Hamas not only the rockets firing...My opinion is that,
    if Hamas weapons were to get more sophisticated, they would use them to kill more
    and more Israelis than before. Israel has always been saying : \"we are targeting
    the Hamas\" but as usual the strong muslim population uses its influence in Europe
    and all around the world  to change it into a \" war agaisnt palestinian\".I I
    even heard the word \"genocide\"...\r\n\r\nFor mister and missis \"Numbers\",
    In an small area such as Gaza, where 1.400.000 people live, who gonna tell me
    that Israel is doing a genocide, who gonna tell me that Israli army doesn't target???\r\n\r\nIn
    Israel, it is written nowhere that palestinian have to die...on the other side,
    Hamas charter clearly states the destruction of Israel and the right to kill all
    the Jews...Israel has the right to defend itself even though people don't believe
    what they say...people only react to emotional images on TV and forget to be rational
    in their judgement.\r\n\r\nI have never seen the press showing so many dead bodies
    on cover page or on TV...Even though most of these pictures are realand sad, only
    Hamas will use it as propaganda (don't forget Palywood and the Hamas CNN strategy).\r\n\r\n(
    for those who base their judgement on numbers)\r\n\r\n1500 casualties in Serbia
    mostly civilians who protest???...Muslim killing each others in many countries
    by 100 of thousand...also the wars in Africa- Rwanda, Congo, Kenya, Zimbabwe...Darfour
    genocide - where are the shoking images??? why muslim or others people don't protest
    against that??? why pro-palestinian demonstrator all around the world support
    \"Hamas \" a terrorist organisation???\r\n\r\nThere is a radicalisation of islam
    in few countries and I don't hear the so-called moderate muslim people raising
    their voices agaisnt them...only a few have the courage to express their opinion
    but they are threathened and experience boycott.That is Islam and democracy:\"
    You have the right to talk as long as it is what I think\"- you have the right

    the answer!\r\nThe fear of reliving the Holocaust does not legitimize racial bias

  content: "[...] CHECK IT OUT [...]"
---
Writing about the middle-east is about as wise as walking into a pub filled with Harley-Davidson bikers and telling them that only <em>babies</em> drive their crap bikes - However, here I am.
Let me state firstly that this post is not meant to piss people off (yet I'm sure it will) nor do I want to create a war on my personal blog however there are things about the whole middle-east conflict that I'd like to get off my chest.
Secondly I'd like to make a point that this middle-east crisis is as a result of a small quota of militant Palestinian militia who have continuously tried to disrupt peace in the region. I don't believe that innocent Palestinians deserve to die nor do I believe that Muslims are the cause of the problem.
While it is easy to look at the current fact that Israel have killed 750 Palestinians in just 13 days of attacks we are all quick to forget the history, and ultimately the reasons, that lead to <em>Operation Cast Lead</em>. Let's look at some of the facts.
<strong>Iran-backed Hamas Rocket and Mortar Attacks</strong>
<ul>
<li>9,400+ rockets and mortars fired from Gaza since 2003. [1]
<li>3,200+ rockets and mortars fired from Gaza in 2008 alone. [2]
<li>6,500+ rockets and mortars fired from Gaza since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. [3]
<li>543+ rockets and mortars fired from Gaza into Israeli territory during the ceasefire from June 19 to Dec. 19, 2008. [4]
<li>28 deaths caused by rockets and mortars fired from Gaza into Israel since 2001. The dead include Israelis, Palestinians and foreign workers. [5]
<li>1,000+ people in Israel injured from rockets and mortars fired from Gaza since 2001, including Israelis, Palestinians and foreign workers. Since the ceasefire, 44 Israelis have been injured and 200 have been treated for shock. [6]
</ul>
The critical point here is that despite a ceasefire militants continued their onslaught and in my mind it is impossible for any country, not just Israel, to continue avoiding attacks on your people when a handful of extremists keep disregarding the peace.
<strong>Condemned by South Africa</strong>
Closer to home though I am extremely upset with the ANC and SACP who have outright condemned the attacks by Israel. They've setup meetings with Israeli ministers to try and get them to stop and just yesterday former Congress of South African Trade Unions president and Congress of the People National Executive Committee member, Willy Madisha, has called on the government to condemn Israel over the ongoing war in Palestine.
The <a href="http://www.sabcnews.com/portal/site/SABCNews/menuitem.5c4f8fe7ee929f602ea12ea1674daeb9/?vgnextoid=42e41ef8a66be110VgnVCM10000077d4ea9bRCRD&vgnextfmt=default">SABC reports</a> that:
<blockquote>Madisha says Israel has for decades been killing thousands of Palestinians in a war that has been condemned internationally. He says hundreds of people are being killed, children are being stopped from going to school and people have no food at all.
"This is a major problem and we are calling the government of South Africa to rise and say to Israel that this is wrong and that it has got to be stopped. South Africa should echo other countries' sentiments so that the Israeli onslaught on Gaza should cease," Madisha said.
</blockquote>
Now the only reason all of this upsets me is because our leaders are quick to jump on this political band-wagon while they've done absolutely nothing about the bigger problem just outside our borders - Zimbabwe. Why they've chosen to pick sides in this conflict and done nothing about the epidemic in Zimbabwe baffles me.
<strong>Fair and Just?</strong>
While I can see the facts and merits of Israel's motivation to protect their nation I'm still undecided as to whether or not <em>Operation Cast Lead</em> is actually the right way of executing their rights. 
Either way, let's not forget that the middle-east is not unique in this scenario as all around the world we have Muslim extremists causing havoc and inflicting <em>Holy Wars</em>. There really is no place in the world for people like this.
Right, I've had my say, and I thought that I'd like to end with this cool comic I found which I believe sums the whole situation up.
