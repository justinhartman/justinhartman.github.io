  content: "fascinating interconnections during your trip\r\n\r\nI have been considering
    iPad and now Flipboard has sold me on the future purchase. Saving all my nickels
    &amp; dimes.\r\n\r\nAlso viewed your October 21, 2010 post on ROI - will use it
    to further convince my church members that it is their words not mine or any ad
    we could purchase that may lead someone to check out our worshiping community.\r\n\r\nThanks."

If you own an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad">iPad</a> then you've probably already installed and using <a href="http://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard for iPad</a> and if you don't yet own one please add Flipboard to your downloads list when you do get one.
Flipboard is an amazing piece of software that creates a personalised magazine of your social lifestyle. By this I mean that you are able to add your Facebook and Twitter account details and Flipboard automatically creates a magazine style format of the latest items from your friends and followers on Facebook and Twitter. It's pretty difficult to explain as you really have to visualise Flipboard for yourself to truly understand what it does. The closest thing I've seen online is <a href="http://paper.li/justinhartman">Paper.li</a> which does a similar thing to Flipboard except Flipboard is way more interactive.
I now hardly use Facebook or Twitter as I can now open Flipboard once a day and consume all the best bits in my instantly updated magazine. Not only that but I can also comment directly and <em>"like"</em> something from within the application and the user experience is simply unbelievable.
Last night I decided to create a new section in Flipboard that just aggregated my own personal Twitter account and I have to admit I loved the results. To demonstrate what I'm talking about I thought that I'd share my Flipboard tweets of my recent US trip to New York and San Francisco. You'll see the progress of my trip in a beautiful, visualised format which really adds context to my tweets. Let me know what you think of Flipboard once you've seen the screenshots below.
