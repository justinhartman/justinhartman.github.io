<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/05/zane.jpg' alt='Zane Meas and Christo Davids' title='Zane Meas and Christo Davids' align='right' />So last night I did something I haven't done in more than six years - I went to the theater. Zane Meas of <a href="http://www.sabc2.co.za/portal/site/sabc2/menuitem.9105f79efb7b713722fb95455401aeb9/">7de Laan</a> and <a href="http://www.twac.co.za">Twac</a> fame stars in the lead role of a beautiful coming of age story set in the coloured community of Riverlea called Shirley, Goodness and Mercy.
The play is a touching and vibrant account of acclaimed South African writer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_van_Wyk">Chris van Wyk</a> and is based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shirley-Goodness-Mercy-Childhood-Africa/dp/0330444832">book</a> of the same name. The theatre version of Shirley, Goodness and Mercy has been adapted by director Janice Honeyman to capture Van Wyk&acirc;&euro;&trade;s love of storytelling and the wonder of a child&acirc;&euro;&trade;s inquisitive mind in stifling and oppressive circumstances.
I have certainly forgotten just how powerful theater can be and the play captured my imagination from almost the very first line. It's wonderfully entertaining and Christo Davids, who plays the young Chris Van Wyk, was absolutely brilliant in his role. In fairness though each and every member of the cast were amazing and I take my hats off to their performances last night.
I think I may just have to do this more often.
