  content: "Hi Justin\r\n\r\nThanks for the post and your feedback.\r\n\r\n\"There
    needs to be an easier way to comment on stories\" - we've deliberately not included
    a direct comment facility on the stories. All stories link back to the original
    source article/website and this we feel this is the best place for readers to
    comment, and for the sites themselves to manage this feedback in the most appropriate
    way.... \r\n\r\nWe're wanting to get more solid \"opinion\" from readers through
    the comment form on the site and will be regularly publishing a selection those
    to highlight what readers views are on the elections and related issues. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nHelen"

  content: "Hi Helen. Thanks for that feedback. It makes perfect sense when you put
    it that way. I would still make the \"share your opinion\" box more prominent.
    It's relatively hidden away at the bottom of the sidebar and it would be great
    to have good quality user generated content.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting to me is
    seeing the voting go up on the site. When I took the screenshot above the DA had
    7 votes, COPE had 4 and ID had 1. \r\n\r\nNow the DA have 33, COPE have 11 and
    ANC 3. I think I'm coming back to the site every day just to see this ticking
    over :)"

  content: "@Justin thanks for the feedback. I'm glad to hear that you will keep visiting
    the site to check on the supporter tally as that's precisely the idea!!!\r\n\r\nI
    suspect that there were some bugs with the comment form that have been fixed since
    you last checked and we will definitely look into integrating Afrigator feeds
    under the blogs section since we know how much that would mean to you ;-)"

<a href="http://saelections.co.za/"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/02/picture-5-499x311.png" alt="SA Elections Website" title="SA Elections Website" width="499" height="311" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-581" /></a>
<a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> newspaper has today launched a new initiative - a website dedicated to the upcoming SA Elections. The <a href="http://saelections.co.za">SA Elections</a> website was developed by Avusa iLab and is by far the best <em>election-related</em> website I've seen in a very long time.
While the design is fantastic I have to admit the real value is really in the functionality and features of the site. First up you can vote for your party of choice and the top-ranked parties are displayed near the header area. I love this and it's going to be very interesting to see how the <em>online</em> community vote in relation to the rest of the country. I'm guessing it will be a lot closer than the actual elections.
The other feature that really stood out is the aggregation of news, not just from The Times, but from all the major news sites in South Africa. While this is a Times powered initiative it's brilliant to see a site dedicated to the interests of democracy and not just re-purposing existing content from their stable.
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/02/picture-6.png" alt="Image" />
There are detailed profiles of each political party as well as the key members of each party and in true Web 2.0 fashion the political profiles have been aggregated from Wikipedia.
This is a great site and really useful but I also have to bring in a few <em>flip-side</em> suggestions. If the guys are reading this then I'd like to suggest the following:
<ul>
<li>There needs to be an easier way to comment on stories and commentary. Use the WordPress model and allow everyone to comment without the need to register.</li>
<li>The comment form is not so lekker. Might need a little sprucing up.</li>
<li>Finally, I think SA Elections needs to have an Afrigator feed in the "from the blogosphere" box. At the moment it's only aggregating The Times blogs and I think this blogosphere box needs the same spirit as the news aggregation box.</li>
</ul>
I think this site is going to be massive for The Times and I wish them all the best with its continued development. Well done guys!
<em><strong>Disclaimer: I used to work for both The Times and Avusa iLab so take this into consideration when reading what I have to say. Despite this I still feel they've done a sterling job without me having to be biased.</strong></em>
