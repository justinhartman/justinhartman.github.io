  content: Marc all thanks to you man. We used the blowing balloon trick on Luke last
    night and I definitely think it helped prep him for what to expect. Personally
    I wasn't sure how to make him feel more comfortable with it but some balloon blowing
    last night did the trick.

  content: Hi Justin, I'm very, very glad that everything went well.  I think it's
    the total feeling of helplessness that is so overwhelming, that can make a grown
    man cry (we, woman, just cry and don't need that feeling ...). Nobody (I mean
    by that no decent and caring parent) would hurt their child intentionally.  But
    I couldn't help feeling guilty and be part of this "experiment" to hurt my child.
    We did, after all, consent to Ian's operation. It's a horrible experience for
    a parent, but in a year's time, he wouldn't even remember it!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/1728490428/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2114/1728490428_5b16286ee7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Luke before his operation" /></a>
This morning Luke had <a href="/2007/10/22/anaesthesia-for-my-4-year-old-son/">his operation</a> and thank God, all went well. I was dead scared about this operation but thanks to some great comments in my earlier post I lost a lot of the pre-op concerns and in truth I was completely fine up until Luke got his anesthetic.
His courage right throughout amazed me and he took to the <em>dreaded mask</em> without a fight or a complaint and I was seriously expecting worse. At the point of losing consciousness Luke started to freak out a little and I was forced to pin him down until he was out and that was my turning point in the whole experience. 
Guilt, helplessness and fear all overcame me and I just wanted to get him out of there - I cried instead.
What I've learned through this experience:
<ol>
<li>Kids are tougher than we give them credit for.</li>
<li>Trust the experts, they know how.</li>
<li>Emotionally I was ready - practically I simply wasn't.</li>
<li>Time in the recovery room is longer than the operation itself.</li>
<li>Don't plan to be at a 9:30am meeting when the op is scheduled for 8:00am.</li>
<li>Take the day off work. I didn't.</li>
<li>Make sure there's lots of yogurt, custard and juice - with straws.</li>
<li>Always have a comfort present for afterwards. We had to get one.</li>
<li>This is certainly not something I'm going to do again in a hurry.</li>
<li>It doesn't take much to make me cry...</li>
</ol>
Luke and Mom are at home recovering and when I left for work he seemed almost back to his normal self.
