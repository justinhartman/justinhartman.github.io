One of the first things I've been working on at <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> this year is a <a href="http://timesurl.at/plugins/sociable.php">TimesURL Sociable Plugin for Wordpress</a>.
The main idea behind it was to incorporate <a href="http://timesurl.at">TimesURL</a> in an easy to use plugin for WordPress but in the end I decided that we don't have a current, updated plugin for social bookmarks in South Africa and hence this plugin was born. 
It is based on Peter Harkins' <a href="http://push.cx/sociable">Sociable</a> plugin but because Peter's plugin is so great I decided that I'd only include the following sites and make it more local by only including popular sites used by South Africans.
<ul>
<li>TimesURL</li>
<li>Muti</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Google Bookmarks</li>
<li>StumbleUpon</li>
<li>del.icio.us</li>
<li>Digg</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
<li>Technorati</li>
</ul>
You an read all about the usage of the plugin on <a href="http://timesurl.at/plugins/sociable.php">this page</a> and once the plugin is activated in WordPress you'll see the following below each of your blog posts.
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2008/01/sociable_plugin_new.png' alt='South African Sociable Plugin for WordPress' />
The plugin has been tested to work on WordPress 2.0.11 as well as 2.3.2 and if you're using WordPress 2.3 then you won't have to worry about checking for upgrades as WordPress will notify you when a newer version of the plugin is available.
Because it's a South African plugin I'd like it to be the definitive social bookmark plugin for this country. If I've missed any sites out please let me know.
