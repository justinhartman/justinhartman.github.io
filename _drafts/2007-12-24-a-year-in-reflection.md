<strong>WARNING: This is my last post for 2007 and I decided I should take this time to reflect&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; it might get sentimental!</strong>
This time last year I had to face the harsh reality that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d be without a job at the end of January 2007. At the time I was working for a company running <a href="http://www.virtualstore.co.za/">this website</a> and when the Christmas rush never came we decided collectively that we&acirc;&euro;&trade;d need to pull the plug on the project.
Not a very good place to be considering that in October 2006 I shut down my web development and hosting company after three years of operation (all due to lack of funding and resources) and I was also in the middle of a litigation battle for a business deal that went sour. All-in-all 2006 was without doubt the worst year of my life and I went into a deep depression and lots of debt as a result of the events that transpired.
We say it every year (well I do anyway) that we hope <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;next year will be better&acirc;&euro;</em> and luckily for me 2007 was.
January 2nd was a turning point in my life. I used this blog to advertise that I was <a href="/2006/12/27/im-looking-for-a-new-job/">looking for a new job</a> and for some strange reason two guys, whom I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d never met, heeded my call. <a href="http://www.mikestopforth.com/">Mike Stopforth</a> and <a href="http://www.daveduarte.co.za/">Dave Duarte</a> rang me up to say they had a client who needed some web strategy work done and would I be interested.
Within days I met Mike, Dave and Johan from <a href="http://twac.tv">Twac</a> at the Nescafe in Eastgate and by the end of January I found myself working at Twac as their Web Strategist. Twac was without doubt the best company I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve ever had the pleasure of working at and without realising it at the time these three, random people helped me to rebuild my confidence and they have helped change my life.
About two months later Mike and I <a href="/2007/04/04/afrigator-the-history-behind-the-project/">were in discussions</a> about doing a localised website similar to Technorati and within weeks we launched <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>. So much has happened with this project that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s difficult to even begin understanding but by some small miracle we&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve created some hype and it seemingly provides some value to users all over the world.
During this time a certain <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/">Colin Daniels</a> had been watching my progress in the blogosphere and early in June I met with him, <a href="http://rantofnote.blogspot.com/">Carly</a> and <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a> for lunch at Dopio Zero in Rosebank to discuss future employment opportunities.
It took a while to make up my mind but by the beginning of July I made the very difficult decision to leave Twac and <a href="/2007/07/05/my-new-position-at-the-times/">join The Times newspaper</a> as their New Media Strategist.
It was a difficult decision because I felt completely valued by the company and this was not an easy thing to leave. In the end though, my decision to leave was based on the idea that I could apply my skills to a big media environment and I was excited at the prospects of doing web-based strategies for a very large audience.
August was also full of surprises as my wife broke the news that we&acirc;&euro;&trade;re <a href="/2007/08/28/a-new-hartman-is-on-its-way/">expecting the arrival of our second son</a>. I have to admit this announcement took a little getting used to but now that I look back at this year I have to say it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s the greatest highlight of the year.
2007 hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t been <a href="/2007/11/05/time-to-rethink-what-im-doing-here/">without</a> <a href="/2007/11/13/sometimes-i-hate-south-africa/">issue</a> but it certainly was a year that had more highlights than it did disappointments.
I look back at this year as one of rebuilding myself and while 2006 was extremely taxing on me and my family it taught me some amazing lessons which forced me to redefine my personal and professional existence.
I have no idea what 2008 is going to hold for me and my family but for the first time in 10 years I won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t be saying <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;I hope next year is better&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&acirc;&euro;</em> but rather, <em>&acirc;&euro;&oelig;long may it continue&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;&acirc;&euro;</em>.
