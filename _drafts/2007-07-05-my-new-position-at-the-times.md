After a couple months negotiation and some pretty hairy decision making processes I've finally signed and sealed a new contract to begin working at <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a>.
On 1 August I'll take up the position of Assistant New Media Strategist and I'm very excited about this career opportunity. I'll be working directly with <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/">Colin Daniels</a> (who becomes my boss) and Editor <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/hartley/">Ray Hartley</a> and I'll also work very closely with <a href="http://rantofnote.blogspot.com/">Carly Ritz</a> and <a href="http://groogle.co.za/">Gregor Rohrig</a> which excites me immensely.
Oh, and I simply can not forget about <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za/bullard">David Bullard</a> either. After calling him a <a href="/2007/05/07/is-david-bullard-an-utter-wanker/">wanker</a> I'm now going to be working with the enemy which should provide some interesting encounters of the narcissistic kind.
Leaving <a href="http://www.twac.tv">Twac</a> was not an easy decision to make however I do feel there is a lot of opportunity for me at The Times. The most important aspect for me in deciding to leave, apart from money of course, was the excitement around being innovative on a fairly large scale level which is something I've wanted for some time now.
I really believe The Times has the right people on board to make it a success and I'm simply honoured to now be a part of it.
