Chances are that if you're reading my post you've already read Mike Stopforth's latest post titled <a href="http://www.mikestopforth.com/2007/03/27/ten-young-south-african-digital-citizens-to-watch/">Ten Young South African Digital Citizens To Watch</a>. If you haven't read it go on over and read it now.
I have personally never seen a personal recommendation in the South African community as what Mike's just done and it is an amazing thing for all the 10 highly talented individuals to have so well done Mike.
I, like Mike, am also starting to feel a little old. All these talented people and they're all much younger than me and I'm still at the tender age of 27. Geez this technoloy thing gets more difficult by the minute.
