When someone told me last night that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/">Business 2.0</a> is closing their doors I simply couldn't believe it. After being <a href="/2007/07/30/it-is-a-web-20-world-and-were-part-of-it/">featured</a> in the magazine a month ago it came as a big shock to the system but the New York Times blog has the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/business-20-rip/">full story</a>. I'm just not sure how you can make such a loss with 623,000 subscribers in your database but I guess this case just shows that traditional media has to evolve - or die.
