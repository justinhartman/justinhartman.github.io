  content: There is indeed not much one can do. I seems hoping that you are not the
    victim is the order of the day in many peoples cases. I also have South African
    Based websites and i too have a love for this country. But not enough to love
    till death. I want to rather live my life in a fearless (even very little) environment.
    This country has got a serious problem. I'd love to get deeper into it but i might
    start offending people. In short this country has systems in place that grant
    for huge crime incentives and a crime wave could very possible be on it's way.
    Thats if we are not already shrouded by it's ever present shroud.

    since working with him at the Montana Spur in Potch many years ago.\r\nRian indeed
    went through a very hard time the last few years and sadly he was on the verge
    of getting on top of things again.\r\nI have not got the courage yet to delete
    Rian from my outlook contacts or my cellphone. I still want to mail and phone
    him, sharing achievements, sadness, jokes ..... \r\nThese bastards took more than

  content: dont you get it. africa is a cesspool. any non white government is a complete
    joke. the primary objective of africans is self enrichment. its payback time boys
    and girls and its gonna get a whole lot worse. the only thing this government
    is interested in is staying in power at all costs with as little effort as possible
    while making as much money as possible. low slef esteem and inferiority complexes
    are the order of the day with name changes and how many blacks are playing in
    a sport they never ever showed much interest in in the first place is top priority.
    everyone in charge knows stuff all about economics or maslows hierarchy of needs
    and would rather stroke the masses egos by getting back at all the whites rather
    than creating jobs and houses for EVERYONE. if you think we can stand together
    and unite as one against them till we are victorious then you are living in a
    dream world. the masses are too ignorant and just plain stupid to understand first
    world principles.

    Round Table in Europe some 10 years ago. \r\nRian &amp; Round Table Stellenbosch
    56 made a lot of friends in Europe.  Almost everyone of us went to SA, and had
    the time of our life with them and explored a magnificent country.  For some of
    us, it was almost more than a dream. \r\nWe even learned about rugby and supported
    the SA team last month.  More : we had a party after the final.\r\nBut tuesdaynight,
    4 PRIMATES, took Rian's, his family's, his friends and our dream away.    For
    us, SA will never be the same again.\r\nWe thank Rian for his friendship, and
    send our deepest feelings and condolences to his family. \r\nRian's European friends"

  content: "I was Rian's partner and friend in his latest \"Wine on Tap\" venture.
    I am an Afrikaner with roots going back to 1700 in Africa. I blame the politicians
    for not building the Rainbow Nation and who allowed their greed to overpower them
    and adhere to no principle anymore. Rian's death is a personal wakeup call for
    me to understand that South Africa is not a normal country. That the Whites face
    a slow genocide, silently condoned by the ANC leadership and implemented by transformation
    of the Rule of Law to anarcy, democracy to one party state politics and new apartheid
    economy that only favour a black elite. \r\n\r\nI am proud of the new South Africa,
    I like the progress we are making towards a non racist society , I believe in
    the goodwill of man, I enjoy multi culture society, I will never be scared into
    racist politics again. But these senseless killings is undermining our county
    in a profound way that cannot be tolerated any more.\r\n\r\nRian's assitent that
    has been with him from the beginning when they were still delivering wine in a
    1984 Datsun Safari is a black man Joseph Zwaai April. Here is his words:\r\n\r\nRiaan\r\n\r\nIt
    was such a pleasure to have met you in my life journey. You have been like a father
    to me who helped me see life its true form.\r\n\r\nAlthough I will sadly miss
    the moments and times we shared together,I will certainly cherish the lessons
    I've learned from you.\r\n\r\nYou have done your bit, now it is the time for your
    to rest in peace. May God see your wonderful soul.\r\n\r\nLove\r\nJosph Zwaai
    April\r\n\r\n\"Lord for you are the spring of life,in your light we shall see
    the light.\"\r\nPsalm 36:9\r\n\r\nOn behalf of myself and the entire April family,
    I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Kerkhof Family.\r\n\r\nFrom: Joseph
    Zwaai April &amp; Family\r\n\r\nWhat more can I say??\r\n\r\nJohan Schutte"

  content: "There is hope for this country and for future government.  There is only
    one party in South Africa that is ready to take a hard line on crime: the ACDP.
    \ The DA as a left-wing party don't support the death penalty.  In addition, the
    ACDP will bring in the highly successful Taiwanese model where prisoners actually
    work while in prison, helping to repay the economy that they're drawing from.\r\n\r\nIn
    moments like this we do still have a role to play in our country in order to prevent
    murders like these.  While crime of some sort will always be a feature, there
    is much we can do to reduce it and to protect our families."

    give up on that [its when things seem hopeless that we need it most], and I trust
    you can be a pillar of strength to those affected in this time, and help restore
    their hope [not easy I know]!<br><br>Stay strong!

  content: dont you get it. africa is a cesspool. any non white government is a complete
    joke. the primary objective of africans is self enrichment. its payback time boys
    and girls and its gonna get a whole lot worse. the only thing this government
    is interested in is staying in power at all costs with as little effort as possible
    while making as much money as possible. low slef esteem and inferiority complexes
    are the order of the day with name changes and how many blacks are playing in
    a sport they never ever showed much interest in in the first place is top priority.
    everyone in charge knows stuff all about economics or maslows hierarchy of needs
    and would rather stroke the masses egos by getting back at all the whites rather
    than creating jobs and houses for EVERYONE. if you think we can stand together
    and unite as one against them till we are victorious then you are living in a
    dream world. the masses are too ignorant and just plain stupid to understand first
    world principles.

    it&#39;s going to be about CRIME in this country and helping end it if at all

Last Friday morning Rian Kerkhof (53) died in hospital after being robbed earlier that Thursday evening. Rian was a good family friend and <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2219490,00.html">news of his murder</a> only made its way to our household early yesterday evening.
Rian was shot in the right side of his body and was then tied to his daughter while the four scum rummaged through his fridge, ate some dinner, cleaned his cottage out and left him there to die. His daughter Helene was visiting him from Thailand and was beaten and taunted all the while watching her father slip away.
<blockquote>"I looked forward to returning to South Africa, but I cannot live in a place where such pigs are terrorising the community. Nobody is safe. It's not enough to rob. They want to kill." -- Helene Kerkhof (21)
</blockquote>
Rian used to own a <a href="http://www.officialmerchandise.co.za/index.php">Sneakers</a> store in Cape Town before he lost his business and it was during this time that he gave me my very first pair of Nike shoes at age 13 and I will always remember him for this - he was my hero.
After he lost his business Rian struggled through the years and I really felt for the man as no human being should ever go through the hardships he went through. The fact that he was so brutally murdered just sickens me to the stomach and this whole incident just makes me furious.
I can't help but feel absolutely powerless when I witness the events that take place in South Africa. I love my country, have contributed on occasion to <a href="http://www.sarocks.co.za">SA Rocks</a> to prove my cause and have even tried to make a small difference with my localised web applications yet at moments like these I just want to run far far away.
When is this lack of respect for life ever going to change? We're a savage nation that cares nothing for the value of life and I'm struggling to come to terms with these brutal murders that take place every day in this country. 
I am often fearful for the safety of my family but when it hits home like this I am completely hopeless.
My deepest condolences go out to Rian's wife and four children - words can not describe the sadness I feel for them right now...
