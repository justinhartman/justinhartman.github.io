This map taken from the <a href="http://www.business2.com">Business 2.0</a> website shows the locations of the <strong>31 hottest startups outside of Silicon Valley</strong>. While highly concentrated around Europe you'll notice that South Africa is featured all thanks to a small little site called <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>.
I'm chuffed and <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2007/07/30/afrigator-featured-in-the-worlds-hottest-startups/">this post</a> will tell you why.
