  content: "While I support almost everything you do say, I must say that I support
    Strauss' decision not to grant Smith a runner. Cramps is not an injury, and to
    be quite honest, if runners keep getting meted out for any old reason whatsoever,
    then fat batsmen the world over will be grinning from ear to ear. Perhaps Smith
    should have taken a fall and 'hurt' himself? That would have worked, but then
    we'd be right back on the 'breaching the gentleman's code' now wouldn't we? :)\r\n\r\nShame,
    do feel for you son though..."

  content: "Yeah I was astounded at Strauss' decision, his dismissal of Smith's pain
    was purely strategic rather than empathetic. It showed a lack of character on
    his behalf. \r\n\r\nI don't believe that it was a turning point in the match though,
    Strauss' england had us by the short and curlies, our bowling attack was shit
    and our top order batsmen - barring Smith of course - didn't perform."

  content: "@Craig, sure you have a point but these decisions need to be taken into
    context. Strauss' decision was calculated and based on bad sportsmanship in my
    opinion. He is quoted as saying \"Being tired does not qualify batsmen for a runner
    under the laws of the game\". \r\n\r\nBy contrast Vettori is quoted as saying
    that \"According to the laws of the game, it was probably out, but of late we
    have discussed a lot about the spirit of the game.\" after the recall of Collingwood.\r\n\r\nSee
    the differences in attitude?"

  content: "@vincent I agree that we probably would have lost anyway but up until
    that decision there was hope. You could see it in the camp, it was diminishing
    quickly but Mickey Arthur and Smith had a sense that there may be a chance.\r\n\r\nAfter
    the decision, Graham got angry and despondent and Mickey Arthur sat with his head
    in his hands for almost the rest of the game. When the coach is hopeless the impact
    that has on players who still have to come out to bat is immense. \r\n\r\nThe
    game was well and truly lost after that decision."

  content: "I have to say I do feel for your son and none of what I have to say is
    a good example for kids as we should be encouraging kids to play not to get embroiled
    in technicalities, but the rules and players actions are ruining this game for
    future generations. I hope he will grow and learn by it. \r\nTo say England are
    at fault is a little harsh as South Africa have an appalling record over the years
    and controversy has followed them around ever since their re-introduction into
    international cricket...Strauss was well within his rights not to allow Smith
    the use of a runner. Even at grass routes levels you are only allowed runners
    if the injury has been caused during the match and not by fatigue. \r\nEven more
    recently in the test match at the Wanderers we have seen Smith not walk on a blatant
    edge behind, the constant sledging and barrage of abuse that seems to go hand
    in hand with South African cricket is certainly against the \"Spirit of the game\".
    \r\nIf you cast your mind back even further Hansie Cronje, national stalwart,
    captain of your national team...exposed as a cheat for match fixing. Do you think
    that's a good example to set for your son as for Gentleman's game and ruining
    the game...I think you may want to look a little closer to home.\r\nI am not having
    a pop at South African in general as Pakistan have a history, as do Australia
    of pushing the boundaries of what's right and what's wrong in the game."

If we're not watching cricket he's bowling balls down the passage or setting his imaginary field and he's driving me nuts with wanting me to purchase every piece of cricket equipment that has ever been made. It's turning into a costly passion.
Over the last two days I've witnessed two jaw dropping incidents in the ICC Champions Trophy, both of which involved England, and these have had a serious impact on Luke. The first and most controversial was an incident involving Graham Smith and Andrew Strauss during the SA vs. England game on Monday evening.
Smith was on 124 runs with South Africa needing another 69 from 36 balls to stay in the ICC Champions Trophy and requested for a runner yet Strauss declined it. After the match Strauss explained that <em>"He asked for a runner and the umpires took the view that cramp is a symptom of fatigue. Being tired does not qualify batsmen for a runner under the laws of the game"</em>.
It is my belief that this decision by Strauss was a defining moment in the match and was a major contributing factor to our loss. After Strauss turned him down you could see Smith's whole demeanor change. Couple that with the fact that he could barely walk and Smith was now forced to look for boundaries to try and steer our team to victory which ultimately lead to the fall of his wicket at 141.
If you asked me Strauss knew that Smith could win the game for South Africa and he wanted him off the field as his bowlers were pretty much ineffective against him. I believe that Strauss broke the rules of the <em>gentleman's game</em> in a display of the worst sportsmanship I've ever seen in cricket in recent times.
The impact this had on Luke astounded me. He was in Graham Smith mode at the time, with pads on and bat in hand, trying to win the game and when he saw how upset Smith was he went from excitement to total disappointment. He got furiously angry with England and accused them on cheating and not being fair and this frustration ultimately brought him to tears. It took a long time to console him and explain to him that sometimes things happen in sport that prevent you from winning but he struggled to comprehend it all.
This was the first time that he's ever understood and been exposed to injustice in sport and he didn't like it one bit. When he went to bed he told us he's never playing cricket again - a truly shattering moment for a child who just wants to be the next AB De Villiers. As parents this was a difficult moment for us and I'm not convinced we handled it as well as we could have. Be that as it may, Luke agreed to take up cricket again the next morning.
The second incident I witnessed was during the England vs. New Zealand match yesterday evening. Paul Collingwood, who had been declared run out after wandering out of his crease, went up to New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori and had a mini-conference with him. Soon after they shook hands and Vettori decided not to uphold the appeal and Collingwood was allowed to continue his innings.
To be honest I'm shocked that England expect every other team to honour the Spirit of Cricket ethos while they only really do so when the pressure is not on them.
It is true that Andrew Strauss had made a similar decision in England's opening match against Sri Lanka by recalling Angelo Mathews however there wasn't the same sense of pressure or intensity during that match. The truth is, when England are on the ropes they are simply bad sports. 
If you don't believe me then lets look at last year when Collingwood was captaining England when New Zealand's Grant Elliott had been run out after a mid-pitch collision with Ryan Sidebottom. The umpires were obliged to rule him out, but Collingwood's refusal to withdraw the appeal had infuriated Vettori and invited widespread criticism from the media.
Vettori's decision yesterday was more significant as there was no case of obstruction in this instance, and Collingwood had no one to blame but himself for venturing out his crease. In addition, it was a do-or-die match for New Zealand yet despite this Vettori still showed outstanding sportsmanship at the time.
You make your own decisions around this but I for one am disgusted by England's tactics and the fact that the ICC continue to back this team and the decisions taken by them on the field. What example are we setting to the youth who idolize these players and the game?
