On Friday I wrote the <a href="/2007/11/30/what-sort-of-message-is-this/">following post</a> in which I criticised <a href="http://www.pnp.co.za">Pick n Pay</a> for allegedly removing the white woman from their banner when they added their new logo to the website.
I also, emailed Pick n Pay and asked them to comment as I really wanted to find out the motivation for doing so and while I have had some correspondence I am still awaiting an official response.
While the general consensus is that Pick n Pay deliberately removed the white woman there have been others who have criticised my approach and claim it was just a simple error on their part.
I visited the Pick n Pay website this morning and look at what I found:
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/12/pnp-revised.png' alt='Latest Pick n Pay website' />
You can now make up your own conclusions about this.
