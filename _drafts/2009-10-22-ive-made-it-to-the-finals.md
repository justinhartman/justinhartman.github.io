I love a good competition. Nothing like the thrill of the chase to drive one nuts. If you're reading this blankly then let me elaborate by saying that I am now one of two finalists in the <a href="/2009/10/18/adtech-adgator-and-me-its-the-perfect-fit/">$3,000 adtech content revenue strategies giveaway</a> which includes a trip to New York to attend the conference.
This is something I really, really want and I am forced to rely on you to help me get what I want. Basically it's now down to public voting and your vote will determine who gets to go. Please can you head on over to Shoemoney's blog <a href="http://www.shoemoney.com/2009/10/20/adtech-contest-finalist-please-vote">by clicking this link</a> and cast your vote for <strong>Justin</strong> in the vote box?
Voting ends on Friday morning and I'm competing against a really great guy so your vote is important and really will help to make a difference.
I must thank everyone who's voted for me so far. The support has been amazing from you all - thank you!
