<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/rexthelion.jpg" alt="" title="Rex The Lion" align="right" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-277" /><strong>I am Rex. Hear me purr.</strong>
<a href="http://www.zoopy.com/member/profile/id/2920">Rex The Lion</a> surfaced at the beginning of this month and the hype around this pussy cat is something to behold. Quite frankly I am  bored. 
Don't get me wrong, I love the concept and <a href="http://www.reallusion.com/crazytalk/">the software</a> they're using is awesome but I feel Rex could be executed far more effectively.
As an anonymous user, who's sole mandate is to talk about the local blogosphere, I would expect Rex to be more controversial but alas all we get is name-dropping and link-baiting which is really not amusing or interesting in the least.
If I were Rex, and clearly I'm not, I'd be ripping bloggers off and really creating some hype. This lack of controversy leads me to believe that Rex is simply a marketing ploy developed by some person/agency to get exposure for something which will most likely be revealed in the near future.
Unlike <a href="http://webtrafficmaker.wordpress.com/">Bolton</a>, <a href="http://www.guymclaren.co.za">Guy Mclaren</a> or even <a href="http://ramboguy.co.za/">Vernon Koekemoer</a> - Rex The Pussy lacks originality in his content and the only thing going for Rex is his cool software.
Come on Rex, let's really see you roar!
