    is that you join the beta list. They seem to be expanding capacity rather quickly!

<a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a> launched a couple days ago and I signed up to be a beta tester but hit what seems to be a major waiting list. Initially Google only allowed 10,000 developers to join but I've read that those invitations were snapped up within the first 10 minutes of the launch. 
Anyway, imagine my excitement when I received this email in my inbox this morning.

Eager to test the new service out I went to the website, logged in, and can now build my first application.

Currently the service only supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> so now I have to figure what to do in this space...!
