  content: "Hey Mike, great news! I figured it out.\r\nOn your iPhone V2 phone visit
    http://unlockit.co.nz\r\n\r\nYou will be presented with a form to add a custom
    APN, Username and Password. For Vodacom I set the APN to internet - not sure on
    MTN or the others.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the APN set on the site you then click
    \"download custom config\". This will ask you to install a file which you should
    accept.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, EDGE and GPRS works perfectly."

  content: "Hi Justin,\r\n\r\nI had a similar problem to this when I upgraded my iPhone
    over the weekend.  Take a look on my blog by this afternoon  (Tuesday 28 July,
    08) - I'll post the workaround that I used to get my EDGE and GPRS working on
    MTN and other prepaid services.\r\n\r\nIt takes a little bit of hackery... In
    short I followed a method similar to that mentioned in 2 above, except, that with
    my method I was able to ENABLE the Cellular Data connection tab under Networking
    that allows you to simply enter a custom APN and username.\r\n\r\nYou will have
    to have OpenSSH installed on your phone in order to do this.  \r\n\r\nIn short,
    I got the carrier .plist file in the bundles folder, I edited it by adding a string
    that enables one to see the Cellular Data Network settings tab, FTP'd the updated
    PLIST file (which I will post for download on my blog) back to the phone, rebooted
    it, and viola, now each time I change my sim from Vodacom to MTN (and I assume
    CellC and Virgin) I simply update the APN and username and password as I used
    to on my 1.0.2 firmware.\r\n\r\nGo to http://www.spirituality.org.za/blogger.html
    in a few hours, I'll have it all up there.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nDion"

  content: I bought two iphones from Digi cape in the Cape. I got a Vodacom card with
    it but put my MTN sim back in. All has worked 100% for last month but recently
    I have to keep re booting to get my e mails on the iPhone. This is happening with
    myself and partner. Do you think it is the network or the phone? Once I re boot
    works again for a while and then stops again.

    and my iPhone shows the E cellular data network icon and I have put the APN etc.com
    but when I try to Brows the web it says &ldquo;could not activate cellular data
    network&rdquo; what is the problem and what can I do?

After <a href="/2008/07/21/first-iphone-20-firmware-hack-in-south-africa/">upgrading my iPhone firmware</a> it's clear to me now that Vodacom's iPhone network is alive and kicking.
I upgraded Colin's iPhone on a Cell C network and none of the localisation functions had kicked in like it did on my Vodacom phone. The real bitch in all of this is that EDGE/GPRS doesn't work on my iPhone while it does on Colin's.
The new version 2.0 firmware no longer has a menu to set you APN key like on previous versions so I decided to see if I could manually change this in one of the preferences files on my iPhone. Look at what I discovered in the XML file:
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/iphone-apn.jpg" alt="" />
The APN key has now been set by the network as <em>iphone.vodacom.za</em> and nothing I do can change this setting as it simply overwrites the string each time.
The result of this is that each time I try connect I get an error message saying <em>"Could not activate cellular data network: You are not subscribed to a cellular data service"</em>.
Seeing as Colin's Cell C iPhone connects to EDGE without any problems I have to believe that Vodacom are going to enforce a data package subscription when the iPhone is officially launched in SA. I also bought a data bundle from Vodacom to see if this would work but I still get that pesky message.
The fact that my iPhone is completely localised, as opposed to Cell C's network, is interesting to say the least. It's a little scary though because as a Vodacom subscriber I can see I'm going to have problems with an unofficial iPhone down the line.
