  content: No Google didn't own them then. The screenshots were taken from WayBack
    Machine. Check the month headings above - they are links to the actual version
    of the site.

This particular post has been sitting in my drafts since July 2008 after <a href="http://colindaniels.co.za">the</a> <a href="http://gregorrohrig.com">iLab</a> <a href="http://www.barnes.co.za">guys</a> <a href="http://www.robinpietersen.com">and</a> I started looking at the similarities between YouTube's logo and another <a href="http://www.sareunited.com/">South African company</a>. This spurred on an analysis of the evolution of YouTube since it's beginning and it was fascinating for me to see how the site evolved over a 12-month period during 2005.
The following screenshots (taken from the <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">WayBack Machine</a>) highlight the key design and functional changes during this period.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050428014715/http://www.youtube.com/">April 2005</a>
There was very little detail available for April 2005 however what I did find interesting was the drop downs that indicate that YouTube may have been somewhat of a dating site. I can't seem to find any reference to this apart from the screenshots and if anyone has any info I'd love to know.
<a href="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/042005.png"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/042005-b.png" alt="April 2005" /></a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050614234128/http://www.youtube.com/">June 2005</a>
In June YouTube introduced search as a dominant feature on the home page and a new tag line, <em>"Your Digital Video Repository"</em>, is conceptualised.
<a href="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/062005.png"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/062005-b.png" alt="June 2005" /></a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050801002005/http://www.youtube.com/">August 2005</a>
By August the <em>classic</em> YouTube is launched with search remaining as a dominant feature however more priority is given to featured videos. This is the first time that YouTube really looks functional and easy to use. Very smartly YouTube drops the stupid <em>"Your Digital Video Repository"</em> tag line and changes it to a more functional one liner, <em>"Upload, tag and share your videos worldwide!"</em>. What's also interesting to note is that this new design highlights the start of the relationship with Google with the introduction of Google Adsense code in the sidebar.
<a href="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/082005.png"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/082005-b.png" alt="August 2005" /></a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050901170944/http://www.youtube.com/">September 2005</a>
Not many changes in September from August but YouTube have now introduced the <em>Recently Viewed</em> functionality to the home page as well as a new <em>Last 8 users online</em> sidebar.
<a href="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/092005.png"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/092005-b.png" alt="September 2005" /></a>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051231232401/http://www.youtube.com/">December 2005</a>
While there are some minor design changes in December the highlight of this screenshot is the introduction of YouTube's now trademarked tag line - <em>Broadcast Yourself</em>.
<a href="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/122005.png"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/07/122005-b.png" alt="December 2005" /></a>
I love looking at the evolution of main-stream products and what I particularly liked about YouTube's evolution is seeing how they struggled to position themselves with their tag line. In <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>'s case we're constantly trying to work on our positioning and we're yet to find the killer one-liner. It's good to see though that as a product evolves along with functionality and simplicity so does the positioning and I'm optimistic that we'll figure this out with time.
