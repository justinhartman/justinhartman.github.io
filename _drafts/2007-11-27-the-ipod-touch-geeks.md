  content: I am indeed Paul and while I could buy it here the cost difference was
    remarkable. Colin picked ours up for R2200 and had we rather opted to buy it here
    we would have had to fork out R3500. That's a massive saving!

All thanks to <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za">Colin</a> both <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a> and I have a brand-spanking new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">8GB iPod Touch</a> all the way from the USA. Didn't take long and we've hacked the poor thing to death. Below is a photo I took of the Geeks running their hacks simultaneously.

And this is the result after hours of deliberation. Well worth the effort if you ask me!
