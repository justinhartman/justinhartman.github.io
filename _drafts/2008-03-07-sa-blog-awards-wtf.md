  content: You raise some important points Justin. These points reiterate my position
    with the SA Blog Awards. What are they actually worth? Not much! The prize is
    a laughable R20.08 , and a 69 x 100 pixel winners badge, nothing more! This is
    not an award you would be hang next to your ICT journalist of the year, or Pulitzer
    Prize, purely because there is no authoritive backing, no serious investment,
    or simply, the respect needed to take such a thing seriously. This annual perpetuating
    debate feeds back into the whole idea of an egocentric close-knit community trying
    too hard to elevate each other&acirc;&euro;&trade;s sense of self by dishing out
    award banners.

  content: "OK, so this sort of post has been coming, whether from you or someone
    else. \r\n\r\nFirstly let me say that 1. I am stoked to be nominated for SA Rocks
    in two categories and 2. I wont comment on the Thoughtleader issue because both
    my nominations are in both of TL's categories.\r\n\r\nSo on to my thoughts:\r\n\r\nI
    agree that transparency is essential to this sort of event/awards. I am not referring
    to transparency from organisers about things like their involvement. That's been
    handled well this year. I think it's important that people know what criteria
    the finalists were selected upon; most votes, most like by organisers/most this-that-or-the-next-thing.
    Whatever, just let us know. \r\n\r\nThen I do think it's important that if you
    are willing to organise this event that you take ownership/responsibility of it.
    ie: make sure decisions are made, expressed and acted upon. Don't leave us in
    the lurch as users/readers/nominees/finalists. Talk to us, get all \"web 2.0\"
    on us. hehehe.\r\n\r\nGroogle is right as far as I can tell and I'm not ashamed
    to admit it. I've said it before, blogging is egotistical and awards, by their
    very nature are ego-feeding. So what? Yes the prize is really a non-entity this
    year and yes there isn't alot of \"esteem\" attached to it in some eyes but you
    know what, i still like to be recognised, as I am sure the other finalists will
    agree. And in fact, I would really like to win at least one award and I will put
    that little badge on my blog if I do!\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think you've written
    a good post Justin. I agree with the judges issue, that is absurd especially when
    the awards are almost over. That needs to be rectified immediately by someone
    involved with the awards. And I'm glad you've posed some solutions and want to
    get involved. Hopefully it'll make the world of difference next year.\r\n\r\nOh
    - my last point and own point - Why the hell do we have 2007 awards 3 months in
    to 2008? Doesn't it make more sense to hold the 2008 awards (the ones for this
    year) at the end of this year closer to November than April of the following year?
    Just a thought."

  content: "Having attended the initial SA Blog Awards meeting at Neo I really thought
    there was potential to elevate the awards to a level that it deserves in terms
    of both recognition and participation. This is its fourth year running and most
    people I know, only heard about it last year for the very first time.\r\n\r\nFirst
    off an award platform such as this requires reputable backers with enough cash
    to sustain both the operations side as well as the actual ceremony. (Cool Runnings
    just doesn't cut it as a venue.) I know of at least one major player who has been
    plaguing me for details on how they can become involved due to the fact that I
    told them there is an opportunity and that because of who they are, they should
    consider backing it. To date they have had very little response form the 'organisers'
    despite the fact that I have followed up on numerous occasions.\r\n\r\nI also
    believe that the awards should be cracked open to a wider audience. Although I
    don't blog, I am an avid reader of both local and international blogs and know
    many of my peers who fall into the same category. Somehow the SA Blog Awards remains
    an 'elitest' platform that the general Internet user (one who does form part of
    the so called blogosphere) hardly knows of or hears about. Surely approaching
    one of the bigger online portals in SA will open up the debate, allow for less
    biased votes and lend the awards more credibility?"

  content: "Gregor I agree with you 100% what value is this award giving bloggers?
    There is no traffic, no money, no prestige (unless you consider the 300 people
    who partake in it) and no authoritative organisation backing it.\r\n\r\nNic, I
    really would have liked to know what your position was on sites in wrong categories
    but I understand where you are coming from.\r\n\r\nTo be egotistical is one thing
    but what does this actually mean? Your comment on this is exactly why this \"community\"
    is perceived as an elitist group of circle-jerkers and no wonder normal people
    just can't get what this blogging and Web 2.0 thing is all about. Who'd want to?\r\n\r\nQuite
    frankly I hate that there are so few people actively involved in the community
    - what about the other 6,000 bloggers on 24.com and the 4,000 on iBlog and the
    however many on Amagamma?"

    at the same time so I'm going to agree with you 100%. Well constructed comment
    and I appreciate that you took the time to have your say.\r\n\r\nLet's get 24.com,
    M&G, The Times, IOL or someone who's playing in the online space to back the awards
    and give it some legs. \r\n\r\nIf next years' awards stay like this then we're
    just perpetuating that 'elitist' environment."

  content: "Justin - what makes my comment so bad? The fact that I want to win? That's
    ridiculous. Why participate if you don't want to win. It's not SA Rocks's fault
    that the organisers didn't open the awards up to amagama, iblog and 24.com. that
    would've been brilliant as we have discussed before. I back that move 100%. I
    am not saying that it's right that the event is perceived as an elitist event,
    it's not right at all, but before we get in to that debate I'd like to know how
    many blogs received nominations in the first round. I think we'd be surprised.
    \r\n\r\nAnd let's be honest we are all very heavily embedded in this elitist regime
    it appears. I must tell you SA Rocks readership is not the blogosphere as much
    as it is the average user commenting on a story they googled. \r\n\r\nAnd it is
    nice to be recognised for your efforts. My comment on this is perfectly justifiable
    dude. If I'm nominated it's nice to win, ego in or ego out, people like to win
    stuff and be recognised by anyone anywhere at anytime. Ofcourse if the awards
    were more reputable with more entires and the like then it'd be better to win
    and to participate. But that's y we are having this debate i guess, to improve
    things."

  content: "I agree on all points. This is my first year as a nominee and I must say
    the experience so far has been bleak. After a bit of investigating I can still
    not assign responsibility of the SABlogAwards to any individual, company or organization.\r\n\r\nAll
    the points made above are valid, only problem is the organizer/s of the SABlogAwards
    seem to have no real interest in communicating to the public or improving their
    service. As such, perhaps the creation of a more credible awards campaign would
    be the best solution.  I would be more than happy to offer my services as a developer/designer
    if any one is interested in starting a new BlogAwards portal. I am sure I could
    get support, exposure and perhaps even sponsorship by a well known ICT publisher.
    I could also arrange free hosting and domain registration.\r\n\r\nJust thought
    I would put the idea out there. Afterall, if the shoe does not fit, get a new
    one."

  content: "Nic, I think you've misinterpreted what I was trying to say. I honestly
    feel that a lot of those sites (sarocks included) deserve an award and some recognition
    because they are good initiatives but at the same time there are some I just completely
    disagree with. But hey, I'm not the public and this is what they voted on.\r\n\r\nMy
    issue was more about the fact that we need credibility to these awards and this
    is lacking. They have tried desperately to be transparent but as I said communication
    has been flawed.\r\n\r\nIn terms of egos and being an elitist I think we need
    to explore this a little. Bloggers, in the old sense, are egotistical. I personally
    don't write my blog so people can say how great I am, I actually do it because
    I just want to share stuff with people that matter to me. If others read my stuff
    - great - if not so be it.\r\n\r\nAwards from a blog perspective are meaningless
    to me - but that's just me. I agree with being recognised for achievements but
    I want to be recognised in a proper way. \r\n\r\nIf I knew 4 million people nominated
    on the Blog Awards then I'd feel proud of my achievements but to just have 300
    people nominate perpetuates the elitist, little-boys club that we ALL belong to.
    I'm no different to you in this regard however I want this to change.\r\n\r\nMy
    question to you is this. Why do you need a badge on your site from people who
    already think you're doing a great job? Does this somehow validate your efforts
    or is it just your ego that would like one?\r\n\r\nWhat happens if you don't win,
    how will you feel?"

    transparency whatsoever in this awards process. I would also like to know who
    the judges are. That should have been annouced at the beginning of the nominations
    process.\r\n\r\nAs for the removal of a whole load of categories, I actually enquired
    into that and was informed that those categories were removed due to 'lack of
    quality nominations' - this is a vague, avoiding-the-real-issue answer, if ever
    I've heard one.\r\n\r\nIf people nominated, those votes should have been carried
    through. Just to ensure that the awards are a proper reflection of the reading
    populace.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree that the awards serve to perpetuate the 'elitist'
    environment - as such, I'd like to know how many nominations were actually cast,
    and how many it took to qualify as a finalist.\r\n\r\nAs a finalist myself, both
    in the best personal blog category (a category that myself and another blogger
    suggested) and best group blog, I dont mind if my personal blog doesn't win. In
    fact, it probably wont. The usual suspects will win.\r\n\r\nBut the group blog
    I run would be much more deserving as it is much better to share a win with others,
    than it is to win alone. And as for the prizes, does anyone even know what they
    are?"

    SA Podcast\" category for the SA Blog Awards.  The description clearly reads \"Best
    independently produced video or audio podcast in SA\".  It so happend that a huge
    number of the nomincations are clearly not independent podcasts and added to that,
    that one of the nominees, 2oceansvibe.com is not even a podcast, but a blog with
    embedded YouTube videos!   I was unable to locate the RSS feed for the Just Plain
    Darren podcast on the webiste and without that, it isn't considered a podcast.
    \r\n\r\nI am extremely greatful for my podcast getting a nomincation this year,
    but I think there should of been some form of obvious filtering done in this category,
    even if the public vote is the exclusive vote.  Jon has been made aware of this,
    but with the rules this year, is unable to do something about it."

  content: "Quite the interesting read and this certainly generated a lot of comments
    ... as I think have all SA Blog Award posts in recent weeks.\r\n\r\nI too attended
    the Cool Running event last year and as events go, it was fairly dull. I enjoy
    the process of being a finalist tho, if only to get my blog exposed to a wider
    audience.\r\n\r\nI think the SA Blog Awards are pretty much a work-in-progress
    and each year some things improve and some stay the same. And it's only thru people
    discussing the flaws that things will improve.\r\n\r\nI have to agree that I don't
    agree with Thought Leader being considered a \"blog\" ... I nominated a specific
    Thought Leader Blog in a certain (discarded) category and I think that's a far
    better approach. If Thought Leader itself should be a finalist (or winner) in
    any category it should be a category like: \"Best SA Web Application for Weblogs\"
    or similar.\r\n\r\nI think there should definitely be more of a consensus regarding
    the award categories :) (I mean really, what kind of award system has a category
    for people writing about the awards?) \r\n\r\nAnd for what it's worth I think
    it's okay that some categories were discarded. If only one SA blog got nominated
    for a category, firstly: perhaps the category wasn't very well thought out and
    secondly: where's the competition, it kinda defeats the purpose. But then again,
    I agree that there should've been a bit of a better explanation around this decision!"

    with the SA Blog Awards. What are they actually worth? Not much! The prize is
    a laughable R20.08 , and a 69 x 100 pixel winners badge, nothing more! This is
    not an award you would be hang next to your ICT journalist of the year, or Pulitzer
    Prize, purely because there is no authoritive backing, no serious investment,
    or simply, the respect needed to take such a thing seriously. This annual perpetuating

  content: 'OK, so this sort of post has been coming, whether from you or someone
    else. <br><br>Firstly let me say that 1. I am stoked to be nominated for SA Rocks
    in two categories and 2. I wont comment on the Thoughtleader issue because both
    my nominations are in both of TL&#39;s categories.<br><br>So on to my thoughts:<br><br>I
    agree that transparency is essential to this sort of event/awards. I am not referring
    to transparency from organisers about things like their involvement. That&#39;s
    been handled well this year. I think it&#39;s important that people know what
    criteria the finalists were selected upon; most votes, most like by organisers/most
    this-that-or-the-next-thing. Whatever, just let us know. <br><br>Then I do think
    it&#39;s important that if you are willing to organise this event that you take
    ownership/responsibility of it. ie: make sure decisions are made, expressed and
    acted upon. Don&#39;t leave us in the lurch as users/readers/nominees/finalists.
    Talk to us, get all "web 2.0" on us. hehehe.<br><br>Groogle is right as far as
    I can tell and I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it. I&#39;ve said it before, blogging
    is egotistical and awards, by their very nature are ego-feeding. So what? Yes
    the prize is really a non-entity this year and yes there isn&#39;t alot of "esteem"
    attached to it in some eyes but you know what, i still like to be recognised,
    as I am sure the other finalists will agree. And in fact, I would really like
    to win at least one award and I will put that little badge on my blog if I do!<br><br>In
    the end, I think you&#39;ve written a good post Justin. I agree with the judges
    issue, that is absurd especially when the awards are almost over. That needs to
    be rectified immediately by someone involved with the awards. And I&#39;m glad
    you&#39;ve posed some solutions and want to get involved. Hopefully it&#39;ll
    make the world of difference next year.<br><br>Oh - my last point and own point
    - Why the hell do we have 2007 awards 3 months in to 2008? Doesn&#39;t it make
    more sense to hold the 2008 awards (the ones for this year) at the end of this
    year closer to November than April of the following year? Just a thought.'

  content: Having attended the initial SA Blog Awards meeting at Neo I really thought
    there was potential to elevate the awards to a level that it deserves in terms
    of both recognition and participation. This is its fourth year running and most
    people I know, only heard about it last year for the very first time.<br><br>First
    off an award platform such as this requires reputable backers with enough cash
    to sustain both the operations side as well as the actual ceremony. (Cool Runnings
    just doesn&#39;t cut it as a venue.) I know of at least one major player who has
    been plaguing me for details on how they can become involved due to the fact that
    I told them there is an opportunity and that because of who they are, they should
    consider backing it. To date they have had very little response form the &#39;organisers&#39;
    despite the fact that I have followed up on numerous occasions.<br><br>I also
    believe that the awards should be cracked open to a wider audience. Although I
    don&#39;t blog, I am an avid reader of both local and international blogs and
    know many of my peers who fall into the same category. Somehow the SA Blog Awards
    remains an &#39;elitest&#39; platform that the general Internet user (one who
    does form part of the so called blogosphere) hardly knows of or hears about. Surely
    approaching one of the bigger online portals in SA will open up the debate, allow
    for less biased votes and lend the awards more credibility?

  content: Justin - what makes my comment so bad? The fact that I want to win? That&#39;s
    ridiculous. Why participate if you don&#39;t want to win. It&#39;s not SA Rocks&#39;s
    fault that the organisers didn&#39;t open the awards up to amagama, iblog and
    <a href="http://24.com">24.com</a>. that would&#39;ve been brilliant as we have
    discussed before. I back that move 100%. I am not saying that it&#39;s right that
    the event is perceived as an elitist event, it&#39;s not right at all, but before
    we get in to that debate I&#39;d like to know how many blogs received nominations
    in the first round. I think we&#39;d be surprised. <br><br>And let&#39;s be honest
    we are all very heavily embedded in this elitist regime it appears. I must tell
    you SA Rocks readership is not the blogosphere as much as it is the average user
    commenting on a story they googled. <br><br>And it is nice to be recognised for
    your efforts. My comment on this is perfectly justifiable dude. If I&#39;m nominated
    it&#39;s nice to win, ego in or ego out, people like to win stuff and be recognised
    by anyone anywhere at anytime. Ofcourse if the awards were more reputable with
    more entires and the like then it&#39;d be better to win and to participate. But
    that&#39;s y we are having this debate i guess, to improve things.

    the points made above are valid, only problem is the organizer/s of the SABlogAwards
    seem to have no real interest in communicating to the public or improving their
    service. As such, perhaps the creation of a more credible awards campaign would
    be the best solution.  I would be more than happy to offer my services as a developer/designer
    if any one is interested in starting a new BlogAwards portal. I am sure I could
    get support, exposure and perhaps even sponsorship by a well known ICT publisher.
    I could also arrange free hosting and domain registration.<br><br>Just thought
    I would put the idea out there. Afterall, if the shoe does not fit, get a new

  content: Nic, I think you&#39;ve misinterpreted what I was trying to say. I honestly
    feel that a lot of those sites (sarocks included) deserve an award and some recognition
    because they are good initiatives but at the same time there are some I just completely
    disagree with. But hey, I&#39;m not the public and this is what they voted on.<br><br>My
    issue was more about the fact that we need credibility to these awards and this
    is lacking. They have tried desperately to be transparent but as I said communication
    has been flawed.<br><br>In terms of egos and being an elitist I think we need
    to explore this a little. Bloggers, in the old sense, are egotistical. I personally
    don&#39;t write my blog so people can say how great I am, I actually do it because
    I just want to share stuff with people that matter to me. If others read my stuff
    - great - if not so be it.<br><br>Awards from a blog perspective are meaningless
    to me - but that&#39;s just me. I agree with being recognised for achievements
    but I want to be recognised in a proper way. <br><br>If I knew 4 million people
    nominated on the Blog Awards then I&#39;d feel proud of my achievements but to
    just have 300 people nominate perpetuates the elitist, little-boys club that we
    ALL belong to. I&#39;m no different to you in this regard however I want this
    to change.<br><br>My question to you is this. Why do you need a badge on your
    site from people who already think you&#39;re doing a great job? Does this somehow
    validate your efforts or is it just your ego that would like one?<br><br>What
    happens if you don&#39;t win, how will you feel?

    That should have been annouced at the beginning of the nominations process.<br><br>As
    for the removal of a whole load of categories, I actually enquired into that and
    was informed that those categories were removed due to &#39;lack of quality nominations&#39;
    - this is a vague, avoiding-the-real-issue answer, if ever I&#39;ve heard one.<br><br>If
    people nominated, those votes should have been carried through. Just to ensure
    that the awards are a proper reflection of the reading populace.<br><br>And I
    agree that the awards serve to perpetuate the &#39;elitist&#39; environment -
    as such, I&#39;d like to know how many nominations were actually cast, and how
    many it took to qualify as a finalist.<br><br>As a finalist myself, both in the
    best personal blog category (a category that myself and another blogger suggested)
    and best group blog, I dont mind if my personal blog doesn&#39;t win. In fact,
    it probably wont. The usual suspects will win.<br><br>But the group blog I run
    would be much more deserving as it is much better to share a win with others,
    than it is to win alone. And as for the prizes, does anyone even know what they
    are?

  content: What should be a joyous time for the community to respect their peers and
    show [ thick enough cheese? ] we really care about everybody and our carbon footprint
    when the reality is our little blogowhatitsname is no bigger than coda&#39;s barge
    poll or David Bullards IQ. <br><br>Every year you all get your knickers in a fat
    knot and make derogatory comments about other peoples mothers. When you have all
    finished with your annual self masturbatory flagellation of how important you
    all are let it dawn like a new rainbow nation that no-one other than the ones
    who run it or whine about it give a flaying faaaaark.

  content: Great post Justin and I thought I&#39;d like to add my views as expressed
    by myself and other independent podcasters in South Africa.<br><br>The "Best SA
    Podcast" category for the SA Blog Awards.  The description clearly reads "Best
    independently produced video or audio podcast in SA".  It so happend that a huge
    number of the nomincations are clearly not independent podcasts and added to that,
    that one of the nominees, <a href="http://2oceansvibe.com">2oceansvibe.com</a>
    is not even a podcast, but a blog with embedded YouTube videos!   I was unable
    to locate the RSS feed for the Just Plain Darren podcast on the webiste and without
    that, it isn&#39;t considered a podcast. <br><br>I am extremely greatful for my
    podcast getting a nomincation this year, but I think there should of been some
    form of obvious filtering done in this category, even if the public vote is the
    exclusive vote.  Jon has been made aware of this, but with the rules this year,
    is unable to do something about it.

  content: Although I think there can be vast improvement to many media awards in
    the tech space, the Blog awards and any other similar accolades does serve the
    purpose of promoting the industry.  I think many people &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; including
    me on many occasions &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; make the mistake to assume that the
    purpose of awards is always to discover and reward the best in its field.  This
    is only partly true&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;  <br><br>To truly reward the best in
    the industry &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; in whatever field &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; is such
    a complex task that one should not expect this to easily happen.  Even with mainstream
    awards &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; like the Telkom journalist of the Year awards &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    many problems occur and controversial choices are made.<br><br>I personally think
    that any awards process should involve readers, writers and industry experts &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;
    assuming that there is a large enough user base.  With limited resources this
    is not possible, which is why many of the top blogs and podcasts are absent.  This
    however does not mean that the awards are useless &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; just less
    accurate than what it can be.  The question really is how inaccurate&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;here
    I can not judge&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;

    awards are a complete and utter crock o&#39; SH*T. The majority of local blogs
    are utter rubbish (mine included) and these awards just perpetuate the myth of
    Web 2.00 stardom in the minds of a few deluded individuals. Wake up and smell

  content: 'Quite the interesting read and this certainly generated a lot of comments
    ... as I think have all SA Blog Award posts in recent weeks.<br><br>I too attended
    the Cool Running event last year and as events go, it was fairly dull. I enjoy
    the process of being a finalist tho, if only to get my blog exposed to a wider
    audience.<br><br>I think the SA Blog Awards are pretty much a work-in-progress
    and each year some things improve and some stay the same. And it&#39;s only thru
    people discussing the flaws that things will improve.<br><br>I have to agree that
    I don&#39;t agree with Thought Leader being considered a "blog" ... I nominated
    a specific Thought Leader Blog in a certain (discarded) category and I think that&#39;s
    a far better approach. If Thought Leader itself should be a finalist (or winner)
    in any category it should be a category like: "Best SA Web Application for Weblogs"
    or similar.<br><br>I think there should definitely be more of a consensus regarding
    the award categories :) (I mean really, what kind of award system has a category
    for people writing about the awards?) <br><br>And for what it&#39;s worth I think
    it&#39;s okay that some categories were discarded. If only one SA blog got nominated
    for a category, firstly: perhaps the category wasn&#39;t very well thought out
    and secondly: where&#39;s the competition, it kinda defeats the purpose. But then
    again, I agree that there should&#39;ve been a bit of a better explanation around
    this decision!'

I feel quite bad about doing this seeing as Mike just <a href="http://www.mikestopforth.com/2008/03/06/sa-blog-awards-my-2c/">used me as an example</a> in his SA Blog Awards post but I have some burning issues which need to aired.
Let me start by saying I think the <a href="http://www.sablogawards.com/2008/">SA Blog Awards</a> has the potential to be a really good thing but every year, without fail, something goes wrong which undermines the integrity of this competition and to be fair I haven't really cared about it until now.
After some delay the voting went live on Wednesday for the blogs that had been nominated by users and there are a couple of issues which need to be addressed.
<strong>Judges</strong>
Seriously, what's up with this? The competition is nearly finished as we still don't know who the <a href="http://www.sablogawards.com/2008/judges">judges</a> will be. I've tried on a couple of occasions to find out what's going on here but <strong>no one</strong> has a clue and there is little response from people who are seemingly involved in the process.
<strong>Categories</strong>
I was particularly upset to see that a lot of the categories that were up during the nomination phase have been removed. I realise that this was probably due to the lack of nominations but surely some explanation could have been provided?
<strong>Incorrect Placements</strong>
As an organiser I would assume there is a level of control over which sites get featured in which category but it seems that the SA Blog Awards is a free-for-all when it comes to this. For example how is it possible for <a href="http://nudjit.com">Nudjit</a> (a site which I started) to get accepted into the Technology category if the site was only launched a month ago? I thought this was the blog awards for 2007.
I also have an issue with <a href="http://www.thoughtleader.co.za">Thought Leader</a> being in the category Best SA Blog. Everyone I have spoken to agrees that Thought Leader is a platform (similar to <a href="http://blogs.thetimes.co.za">Planet Blogs</a>) but with a push it could be a group blog.
I haven't spoken with either Vincent or Matt about their thoughts on this however this isn't an issue with Thought Leader but rather an issue with the organising committee who allowed this to happen. You can twist this any which way you want to but Thought Leader isn't a blog as much as Nudjit shouldn't be in the blog awards this year.
<strong>Communication</strong>
While these issues above aren't the be-all and end-all of things I do have a very serious problem with the communication. I personally have no idea who runs the competition (I know <a href="http://www.cherryflava.com/">Jon Cherry</a> is involved) but right from the start communication by the organisers has been appalling. I really would have liked to see what the motivation was for removing categories, why no one has bothered to explain why there are no judges for the competition and overall what the status was/is on the competition (i.e. delays, processes, etc.).
<strong>The SA Blog Awards is a farce and provides absolutely no value or true reflection of the state of blogging in South Africa.</strong>
Mike was very opinionated about people moaning and not doing anything about this so in the spirit of his post I'm going to offer my assistance for the next blog awards. I'm not sure if the organisers will want me after this post but at worst I can assist them with the communication aspect which is the biggest flaw in my opinion.
