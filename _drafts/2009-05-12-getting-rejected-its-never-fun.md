  content: Dust it off mate, Look at what you've already achieved. TED fellowship
    should be patting you on the back. For what it's worth, you inspire allot of people.
    Keep it up!

    wouldn't be worth the time now and I wouldn't get it.  Appears that if you and
    Alanna got shot down, then I was right.\r\n\r\nI figure with sites like ours,
    being invited to speak would be a much more impressive honor.  That's what I'm
    waiting for, although my breath is most certainly not being held.\r\n\r\n-miquel"

While this blog has been a lot about my good news lately, today it's a lot about my bad. If you've been reading my blog then you'd know I was chosen as a nominee in the <a href="/2009/04/16/ive-been-nominated-for-the-2009-mens-health-best-man-awards/">Men's Health Best Man Awards 2009</a> and last week I received an update to inform me that I was not chosen as one of the three finalists. Congratulations though to <a href="http://www.vinnylingham.com/">Vinny Lingham</a> who did make it as a finalist in another category and I wish him all the best because he deserves it!
To be honest I'm not disappointed about not being a finalist because if you look at who else was nominated in my category then you'll understand why I was flattered to even be considered in the first place. I was expecting a rejection email and as such the nomination is going to make a great addition to my CV.
The second rejection I received last night and this one has been bitterly disappointing. About two months back I applied for a <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/fellows">TED Fellowship</a> and despite being extremely confident that I'd crack it I didn't quite make the grade. Herewith an excerpt from said rejection email.
<blockquote>The response to the new Fellows program has been exceptional - far greater than we could have imagined - and winnowing down the application pool was a formidable task. Unfortunately, due the to extraordinary qualifications of all of our applicants, we are unable to offer you a Fellowship for TEDGlobal 2009. 
</blockquote>
If any of you have ever applied to be a TED Fellow you'll know just how strenuous the application process is. To apply you need to complete an application by answering various questions that try to gain insight into how you tick as a human being and then you have to get references to fill in referee forms on your behalf. It's kind of like writing your year-end exam only <em>much</em> tougher!
It took me over two weeks to complete my answers to the questions and in it I told TED stuff that only my family know. I really shared every inner-most secret in the hope that doing so would get me a seat at the conference.
The anticipation in waiting for an answer was the real killer though. I didn't want to entertain any negative thinking so I convinced myself that my ticket was booked and I was headed for Oxford. I realised that the risk of doing so was utter, gut-wrenching disappointment but I wasn't going to allow myself to ruin the small chance that I had.
Unfortunately my gamble didn't pay off and I honestly feel like a teenager who's girlfriend has just dumped him for a smarter, better looking guy. It has long been a dream to attend a TED conference but I guess my time will have to wait...
For now I'll continue to watch from the sidelines and I thought this latest video from <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/538">Seth Godin titled Why tribes, not money or factories, will change the world</a> would be an apt way to end this post. Enjoy the brilliant talk from Seth as he shares ideas on how tribes give ordinary people the power to lead and make big change.
