    Mac users are not really interested in IE, but as I said, web developers need
    to test for it, so this is a great implementation just for that!"

    for me and I guess any Mac web-designer or developer."

  content: "As I said - it will appeal to a bunch of people that have Macs and need
    IE.\r\n\r\nHave you tried browsershots.org?\r\n\r\nSo according to HitsLink, about
    75% of internet users worldwide use IE. I'm guessing that the major reason for
    this is that more than 90% of the desktop OSs in the world are Windows, and that
    100% of them have shipped with a version of IE.\r\n\r\nhttp://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=0\r\n\r\nCouple
    that with a generation of computer users who don't want to mess around with software
    installs and plugins and other stuff, and just want Internet access - and you
    get to 75% very easily.\r\n\r\nBut what I said is true, in that there is a growing
    trend to move away from IE: http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=1.
    Note how the numbers changed dramatically after October 2007. Falling almost 1%/year.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I should have said \"stick to <i>switching to</i> Firefox\". FF has just proven
    itself over and over again. And given that Dell started shipping Ubuntu machines
    (with FF as the OS's browser of choice), we might see an even steeper decline
    in IE popularity.\r\n\r\nUnless - as I said - there was an uber-talented MS developer
    that created a new browser that completely put the rest in the shade, and then
    shipped it with Windows 7.\r\n\r\nAll these things take time, so it'll be a while
    before we see any of this come to pass.\r\n\r\nAnd as far as development goes
    - I deliberately use an older version of FF (1.5.0.13). Because if it works on
    here, it will probably work on any later version of IE, Opera or Safari that you
    can throw at it ;)\r\n\r\n~ Wogan"

  content: Thank you for this incredibly valuable information. I have been looking
    for a solution to get IE on my mac for ages to test the websites I develop and
    this is a great solution. One question though, I've installed Darwin and ies4osx
    and I got Internet Explorer 6, which is great. But in your blog, you mentioned
    that ies4osx could install IE 5, 5.5, 6 and 7 beta and I can't find how to do
    this. I looked in the toolbar of ies4osx app, but couldn't find anything about
    this. Could you give me some advice here? Many thanks in advance!

When I was using <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> as my primary operating system I installed a very handy application called <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">ies4linux</a> which allowed me to install and run Windows-based Internet Explorer 6 and 7.
These browsers are able to run on Linux all thanks to the Open Source implementation of the Windows API called <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> which acts as a compatibility layer for running Windows programs. It has been very useful in the past for <em>checking</em> websites for compatibility across the different browsers and I've long hoped for a <a href="http://apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> derivative...
Finally it seems some <a href="http://mike.kronenberg.org/">clever person</a> has ported this application to Mac and it's quite aptly called <a href="http://www.kronenberg.org/ies4osx/">ies4osx</a>.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/2278793451/" title="Internet Explorer on Apple OS X by Justin Hartman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2221/2278793451_5d15d422ff.jpg" width="474" height="237" alt="Internet Explorer on Apple OS X" /></a>
Installing ies4osx was relatively simple and as with the Linux derivative it requires a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)">Darwin</a>-based installation of Wine called <a href="http://www.kronenberg.org/ies4osx/">Darwine</a>. Once everything has been installed you simply open up the browser you want to test on and the results are just awesome.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/2279584822/" title="IE6 Running on Leopard by Justin Hartman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2355/2279584822_d6f1f3b61a.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="IE6 Running on Leopard" /></a>
ies4osx runs off <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/">Apple's X11</a> implementation and is able to install Internet Explorer versions 5, 5.5, 6.0 (SP1) and 7.0 BETA but it remains a little buggy. The stability issues all relate to the Wine implementation as I had similar stability issues using ies4linux. This is a great step for Apple users and now I can finally uninstall that dual-boot Windows XP from my MacBook Pro.
