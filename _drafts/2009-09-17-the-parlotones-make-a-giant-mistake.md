If you haven't heard the news yet then let me tell you that <a href="http://www.theparlotones.co.uk">The Parlotones</a> are now <em>wine makers</em> and last night we were privileged to attend a private, intimate launch party for their new red wine called <a href="http://theparlotoneswine.com/">Giant Mistake</a>.
It is no secret that I'm a Parlotones fan-boy (as is evidenced <a href="/2009/02/02/the-parlotones-concert/">by this post</a>) and this once in a life time opportunity event was certainly not going to be missed by me and trust me, I had a fantastic time.
If you know me well enough then you'll know that I am often mature beyond my years but last night I was like a teenager again. Singing, jumping, irritating <a href="http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/Pages/profilefull.aspx?IndID=6902">Mark Bayly</a>, asking the band for special requests, pestering Kahn for signatures and photos and just generally being an absolute nuisance. I had a blast and now have some cool signed memorabilia including a signed bottle of Giant Mistake by all the band members. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/justinhartman/sets/72157622270440469/">Check out some of the pics from the night</a>.

But this post isn't all about the fun. As I <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2009/09/17/the-parlotones-and-afrigator-team-up/">mentioned on the Afrigator blog</a> we actually got involved with The Parlotones on this and did some work with them on their new website and there's some more exciting stuff in the pipeline.
As for the wine? Well if the crowd last night at the event are anything to go by then Giant Mistake is going to be a massive success. There wasn't a single person who said they didn't love the wine and if you're a sceptic then I guess the proof will have to be in the pudding. I mean we are just human after all...
