So on Friday I posted a video called <a title="coolest guy internet" href="https://justin.hartman.me/2009/01/30/coolest-guy-on-the-internet/"><strong>coolest guy on the Internet</strong></a> and I must apologise if it seemed somewhat random.
See the thing is we're running a little competition within the <a href="http://www.mihinternet.com">MIH Group</a> in which we're trying to see if we can rank number one on <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> for the search term <a href="http://coolestguyontheinternet.net/">coolest guy on the Internet</a>.
The competition is a short one that won't last very long and in due course I'll post my techniques and other strategies and evaluate where and how I performed. Until then, sorry for the randomness!
