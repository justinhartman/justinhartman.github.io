  content: Wow great news! It seems like Cape Town is the place to be at the moment.
    All the more reason for me to move as well. Stii, you and I need to have a beer
    or a coffee next time I'm over! I have lots of ideas relating to Afrigator and
    how we can tie it in with Muti.

  content: Good luck, since you asked for it, but I don't think luck is necessary.
    Seems like this is a well deserved break, an opportunity you just couldn't pass
    up - not many people get the opportunity to focus on what they love doing, and
    even fewer have the courage to take that opportunity. Kudos :-)

Today is my last day at Avusa iLab. At the beginning of September we announced that MIH Print Africa had <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2008/09/05/mih-acquires-stake-in-afrigator/">acquired a stake in Afrigator</a> - a project I've been working on since early 2007 - and as a result I've been finishing up work and preparing for the big move down to Cape Town.
Making the decision to leave was simple to make in that Afrigator is a passion of mine and I've now been given the opportunity to work on my passion full time but on the <em>flip-side</em> it was also extremely difficult. Over the last 14 months I've built up very special relationships with <a href="http://colindaniels.co.za">Colin</a>, <a href="http://www.gregorrohrig.com">Gregor</a>, <a href="http://www.ian-judiet.za.net/">Ian</a> and <a href="http://www.robinpietersen.com/">Robin</a> and we've grown very close as a team and as a friends.
Together I believe we have provided immense value to the company and I know that I am leaving the iLab in very capable and safe hands. I will now have the opportunity to sit back and watch what the guys produce over the coming months and I look forward to seeing them assist in helping the company reach its goals and objectives.
All I can say is that they will all be sorely missed.
Moving to Cape Town is something I and my family welcome and are looking forward to and while we'll all miss our family and friends this move will be a life-changing experience for us all. As a parent I couldn't ask for more than to bring my kids up in a city that has so much to offer and our quality of life is going to improve dramatically as a result.
Packing is now well on its way and on Sunday morning we move into our new home in Claremont. I don't think we can yet quantify what this all means but I'll post my experiences on the blog in the coming days and weeks.
Wish us all luck.
