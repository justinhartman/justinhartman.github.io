  content: "Hi Justin, tks for your post.\r\n\r\nIt is very important IMO to choose
    the right system. This is particularly important when doing mass mail, even to
    subscribers.\r\n\r\nI only trust 1 system, and will never trust any other (any
    time soon), and thats aweber.com\r\n\r\nCheck them out, and check the reviews
    too. I have used them successfully for 3 years now to email SUBSCRIBERS and no
    probs.\r\n\r\nBe warned though, they do not allow ANY dodgy behavior, so only
    use this if you plan to be 100% above board (I'm sure you are). :)"

  content: "i find that the only time newsletters work is when the client specifically
    wants it, so they must subscribe. just because they are current clients does not
    mean that they want or need your emails.\r\n\r\ni have 2 clients that got burned
    like that, they assume that since they are clients they would want the emails.
    big woopsy :)\r\n\r\ni use campaign monitor myself and i find it awesome. mailchimp
    is nice too :)"

  content: This is a concern of mine. I feel its the only way to get any new products
    out there, but I am worried that I may p-off some customers.  I try keeping newsletters
    very short, only highligting new products and interesting links.

  content: "@Nell-Louise as Jonathan said I think as long as people have actually
    signed up for your newsletter then they're expecting you to contact them. Where
    we went wrong is that we \"assumed\" that because we have all these people as
    our clients that we could just email them but in hindsight this was the wrong
    approach. What we should have done is email them and asked them if they wanted
    to receive newsletters and then allow them to signup on a different list. Stupid
    mistake that cost us dearly.\r\n\r\n@Jonathan, spot on the money mate. This is
    exactly where we went wrong!!!!\r\n\r\n@John - Mailchimp is exactly the same,
    no dodgy behaviour so I think we'd have been alright with aweber!"

  content: "Did Mailchimp delete your account because of spam complaints against you
    by your users?\r\n\r\nI've recently discovered that South African spam law differs
    from US. In the States, email newsletters have got to be double opt-in. In SA,
    you can subscribe users to your newsletters <a href=\"http://www.macgeek.co.za/2009/09/21/south-africans-its-legal-to-add-people-to-your-newsletters-without-their-permission/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">without their permission</a>.\r\n\r\nThis is crazy! It means
    that genuine spammers can go about there business, and genuine marketers can act
    within the law, and there's no difference between the two from the end user perspective.
    What's worse is that a genuine marketer feels like they're acting within the law,
    but the people receiving their stuff feel spammed. Which isn't great for a brand.\r\n\r\nJonathan
    is quite correct: a once-off email asking people permission to subscribe to your
    newsletter (by an action *they* must take) is the best solution.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised
    that you're canning the Afrigator newsletter all together. Why not put together
    a nice-worded apology mail - a once-off - and re-start your database?"

  content: "Also, I think you need to look at the market you're dealing with. Our
    users, for example, are more tech-savvy and as a result I don't believe they read
    newsletters. In another context newsletters are a critical communication tool
    that people actually want and chose to receive.\r\n\r\nI know that if I look at
    myself, I simply delete (or unsubscribe) from newsletters as soon as they hit
    my inbox and I suspect Afrigator users are similar in this reaction - doesn't
    matter who it's from."

    with users who unsubscribe, but rather users who mark the emails as spam, with
    services like gmail and hotmail.  Anything over 0.1% of your messages being marked
    as spam could get you into trouble."

  content: "@Roger - sorry your comment ended up, ironically, in my spam comments
    folder and only saw it now :-)\r\n\r\nI just want to be clear about this. Our
    account was not deleted but rather we closed the Mailchimp account. According
    to Mailchimp our email lists were actually very healthy (i.e. not many complaints)
    but we just decided it wasn't worth it.\r\n\r\nWe may certainly explore this again
    in the future but we'll approach it VERY differently. Next time we'll ask users
    if they want to receive emails from us and then we'll manage that process better.\r\n\r\nFor
    now though we don't really have the resources to focus on this when it's not really
    helping our business so until we can see a serious business case for this I doubt
    we'll revisit it soon."

<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/09/Screen-shot-2009-09-22-at-3.53.12-PM.png" alt="Mailchimp Account" title="Mailchimp Account" width="452" height="169" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840" />
Let me start by saying that <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> is an amazing company and their bulk email service is worth every penny. They deliver a punchy service and their UI is awesome however we no longer use them as our account has now been deleted. 
I certainly can see the value in newsletters but from experience <em>our</em> newsletters were more often than not perceived as spam and I think, ultimately, this has hurt our brand. Added to the fact that many of our @afrigator.com email addresses now end up in people's spam/junk folder and I think you'll see why we've ultimately decided to drop our newsletter service all together.
Maybe our execution was poor, maybe we're just not experts at doing this but I can tell you in future I'll be hesitant to send out any emails to users. It's a tough one for a small online business as email is, fundamentally, your only communication tool with your clients and this tool needs to be used very wisely........ or else.
I can in all honesty tell you that we've learned more than we'd have liked to (mostly painful stuff) and if I had to do it all again I would have never started email newsletters in the first place. We had all these grandiose ideas about how we could leverage off email to our users but in the end I think we failed.
