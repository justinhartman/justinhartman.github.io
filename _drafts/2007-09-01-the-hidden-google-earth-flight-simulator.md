Hidden inside Google Earth is a secret Flight Simulator that takes full advantage of Google&acirc;&euro;&trade;s extensive satellite imagery.
To access the hidden feature, open Google Earth and hit Command+Option+A (note it must be capital A) or Ctrl+Alt+A if you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re using a Windows Machine.
The Google Earth Flight Simulator comes with two aircraft options, a F16 Viper and a SR22 4 seater. You have the option of commencing the game from your current location in Google Earth or can pick from a list of pre-determined runways. Control instructions can be <a href="http://earth.google.com/intl/en/userguide/v4/flightsim/index.html">found here</a>.
Below is a short video of my first experiences using the flight simulator. I took off from San Fransisco airport and landed, well... you're just going to have to watch but I can say it was a very bumpy ride.
