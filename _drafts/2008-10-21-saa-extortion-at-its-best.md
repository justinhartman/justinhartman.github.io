    my account. SAA have shot themselves in the foot with this one. Dr. Khaya Ngqula
    - isn't he the guy who was on Carte Blanche for running the company into the ground?

    not use. There is an agreement between the banks and credit card companies that
    a credit card payment can be bounced if the services were not provided. As you
    have not used the ticket there were no services provided it can be bounced. When
    you contact your bank they will pretend that no such thing exists but it is there.

    I hope this gets resolved. Don't pay them until they admit to thier mistakes.

  content: The biggest issue with Stupid African Airlines is that they simply don't
    care. There is a learned behaviour that they don't actually have to do any work
    and when they need cash the tax payer bails them out anyway. The irony is that
    the 4 grand you spent would have gone to SAA eventually anyway.

    called it quits. \r\n\r\nKulula is by far the best local carrier IMHO. However,
    even Mango, which is affliated with SAA, kicks SAA's butt!"

  content: "@Byron - I looked at Hellopeter last night. I decided not to use it because
    surprise surprise SAA are one of the companies that DO NOT respond to complaints
    on the site. According to hellopeter there are 370-odd complaints and 20-odd praises.\r\n\r\n@Luke,
    yes he is the same guy.\r\n\r\n@Chris, thanks for commenting and stopping by.
    I have already tried this route. MasterCard won't issue a full refund until they've
    investigated and I will have to wait between 120-180 days for a verdict from them.
    Go figure...\r\n\r\n@Marc, unfortunately I have already been forced to pay. If
    I had my way I would move completely away from them but the one ticket which is
    accurate and paid for is forcing me to stick with them. Unless of course I want
    to lose that money as well.\r\n\r\n@Saulk. I couldn't agree more. This whole experience
    has been completely draining and made me sick!\r\n\r\n@Dave, I've never used Kulula
    but I think I will now :)"

    There might not be as much space but the last 3 times i have travelled i have

    up paying an extra R300 (R100 + the difference in the ticket price). \r\n\r\nMy

    SAA style - the fact that they are losing money and over fist and can't make money
    even with underhand techniques like this...\r\n\r\nIf I were you I would turn
    the power of the internet / media / blogosphere against them. \r\n\r\nPick a name
    and zero in on it. You've been robbed - draw a line in the sand and make a public
    letter to the GM of SAA indicating that failure to refund will result in legal
    action. \r\n\r\nAttach a letter of demand for refund from a lawyer (they cost
    a couple hundred rand) and then post it and forward it...\r\n\r\nYou gotta zero
    in on a name though - if you don't they will remain nameless and faceless - you've
    been defrauded boet and if you don't take a stand it will happen again to somebody
    else.\r\n\r\nYou've got my mail address - got some nice media contacts who will
    take a slug at the problem as well...\r\n\r\nAmazing what can happen when somebody
    gets brought into the firing line. Have had some success with iBurst and FNB when
    the right attention is brought onto the right people...\r\n\r\nJust a thought

    else for that matter) then the client takes the full risk of me not appearing
    OR them getting ripped off.\r\n\r\nSAA queues are always the busiest in the morning.\r\nTheir
    staff don't care (see my blog post about this).\r\nThe cabin crew are indifferent.\r\nThe
    experience of flying SAA is something I choose to avoid.\r\n\r\nBritish Airways
    are smart, efficient, friendly &amp; on time. And about 10% cheaper than SAA.
    They come with my highest recommendation - and I've had to fly a LOT this yea."

    sister and I. I can't find any email ad. Can you only complain by phone? Thanks\r\nAppauling
    what they did to you! That's error on their part. I once travelled with SAA and
    asked an air steward to help me put a bag in the overhead locker, he refused because

It's Luke's birthday in November and as a special birthday gift Colette and I have decided to fly his grandfather and my sister (his aunt) down from Jo'burg to spend some time with him over this time. We figured that he could use a little familiarity what with us relocating to Cape Town so today I set off to book two plane tickets online.
My first choice would have been British Airways (R4,000) but they seemed way too expensive and I couldn't see much difference between Mango (R3,100), Kulula (R3,200) or <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA</a> (R3,477) so I decided to opt for an airline that was trusted to arrive on time and booked my two tickets with <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA</a>.
When I received the confirmation of the booking via email I noticed that my father-in-law's surname was not correct and had been replaced with my full name. So, it looked a little like this <em>ROBERT JUSTINHARTMAN</em> on the confirmation slip. I immediately called the <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA call center</a> to have this surname changed.
To cut a <em>very</em> long story short <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA</a> do not change surnames on tickets that have been paid for. Had I not paid my ticket straight way I would have been able to edit these details but being a good customer is actually a negative thing in <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA</a>'s opinion.
The error <em>allegedly</em> occurred as a result of me adding in my own frequent flyer number in the booking form at the time of booking. By doing so the <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA booking system</a> automatically updated the surname in my father-in-law's text box with my full name and as a result I now had a ticket that was totally and utterly useless.
<strong>The result:</strong> I have to cancel the old ticket and rebook a new ticket under his <em>real</em> name.
<strong>The caveat:</strong> I have to pay again and I'll only be refunded the airport tax from the original ticket - <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA</a> keep the airline fee.
I fought with two different consultants and their supervisor for a little over two hours. The bottom line. I'm screwed. <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA</a> refuse to back down even though their system is flawed.
I gave up at the time and just booked a new ticket. This means that instead of R3,477 I have now paid R5,352 less my airport tax refund of R895.00 for this system error and I've lost just short of R1,000 in the process.
I feel robbed by these twits and totally helpless but the more I've thought about the events that transpired the more I realise that I need to stand up for my rights. I personally wouldn't do business like this so why should I stand for it? This is simply consumer extortion.
As of this morning a letter of complaint, demanding a full refund of my original ticket purchase price, has been sent to Dr. <a href="http://saasucks.com/">Khaya Ngqula</a> - CEO of SAA and the customer service department. I've only ever written one other complaint before which was to BMW and I had success with it so I'm hoping for much of the same.
Having said that though I'm not optimistic for a positive outcome. Unlike BMW I have come to realise that <a href="http://saasucks.com/">SAA</a> couldn't give a flying **** about their customers and I can't see them doing a turn-around now.
