    and many many people will refuse to support them.\r\n\r\nI am sure some amicable

I'm not sure how I feel about this.

Regator.com went into private beta today and I picked it up via this <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/03/regator-wants-to-be-a-blog-reader-for-the-masses/">Techcrunch article</a>. They've also got great exposure on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-tb.cgi/4353">ReadWriteWeb</a> and even <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/03/regator/">Mashable</a>.
<a href="http://www.regator.com/blog/?p=21">These guys</a> are a blog aggregator that not only use the <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> crocodile, similar domain name and colour scheme and I have to feel this is a little more than a coincidence.
There is little doubt that <a href="http://www.mikestopforth.com">Mike</a>, <a href="http://stii.za.net">Stii</a>, <a href="http://www.markforrester.co.za">Mark</a> and myself will need to speak to our <a href="http://jacobson.co.za/">legal team</a> to find out what action we can take on this.
What do you guys think?
<strong>UPDATE: I've had a long chat with Scott from Regator and I'm now convinced it was a coincidence. Please see my <a href="/2008/07/04/regatorcom-update/">updated post here</a>.</strong>
