<a href="http://www.stormhoek.co.za/own-a-vine-save-a-job/"><img src='/assets/images/uploads/2008/03/sotrmhoek.png' align='right' alt='Stormhoek' /></a>Last night I had a great evening with both <a href="http://stii.za.net/">Stii</a> and <a href="http://blog.bizcommunity.com/index.php/simone-puterman/">Simone</a> at Doppio Zero in Greenside. Lots of fun was had by all but more importantly we discussed some very serious issues ranging from work, life, parenting, blogging and the <a href="http://www.stormhoek.co.za/own-a-vine-save-a-job/">Stormhoek saga</a>.
Erik has a <a href="http://whiteafrican.com/?p=944">great post</a> about the <em>pothole theory</em> and part of this theory is how we find it easier to care about those matters closest to us and why fixing a pothole in your road is seemingly more important that addressing some of the larger issues we are faced with today. 
This kind of sums up why I haven't written about Stormhoek before because I've been unsure of how I could contribute. Also, I wasn't sure if blogging about this would actually make a difference but that's a naive take to things. 
I've learned in the last few days just how powerful blogging can be and hey, let's face it, Stormhoek grew into the powerful brand that it is through the use of blogging and social media.
Many people feel very passionate about this issue as <strong>real jobs</strong> are at stake here and the future of Stormhoek is in jeopardy. In particular I've been impressed with people like Stii and <a href="http://www.evedmochowska.com/">Eve</a>, read <a href="http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article.aspx?l=196&c=16&i=22668">this great article</a> on Bizcommunity, who've really tried to make a difference.
I think that as an online community, who've all benefited from Stormhoek sponsorships, we should try our level best to help Graham, <a href="http://www.wonderingi.com/">Chris</a> and the rest of the team by helping them recover some of the <strong>R6 million</strong> that is owed to them. Unfortunately I can't afford to <a href="http://www.stormhoek.co.za/own-a-vine-save-a-job/">Own a Vine</a> but I hope that others who can will help fight the cause and help save the company.
At the very least, let's get the message out there!
