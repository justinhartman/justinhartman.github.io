    are some really interesting and also some scary stats highlighted in that clip.\r\n\r\nSome
    of those stats are inspiring, while others are really worrying, so I guess I have
    mixed emotions about this piece."

OK, so I had all these thoughts about the video embedded below and I really wanted to go into detail to explain the context, where it came from, what it means for me (and you) but in the end I've decided to just embed it and let you make up your own mind. I have little doubt that if you haven't seen this yet you'll absolutely love it. I hope that it helps shift your perception...

If you've watched it and want some background info I suggest you read the following links.
