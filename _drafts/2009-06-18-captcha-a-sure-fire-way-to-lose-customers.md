  content: Heya! I hear you, sometimes these chaps just eat my goat, but I'd rather
    have a working version (which there are out there somewhere - just do some more
    digging), than have 100s of BotComments on my blog etc etc...

  content: "Hmm, I too share the dislike of captcha, in this case its clear that something
    clearly went very wrong and could probably be tracked to some sort of strange
    breakdown between the cookie and the sites general graps on reality.\r\n\r\nStill
    searching for the alternative though, there is sometimes a need to add that extra
    hurdle into a process to avoid easy (note I am saying \"easy\") exploitation.
    \r\n\r\nHave seen some quirky things like the one google is working on where you
    have to flip the random upside-down images in a generated image sequence.. sigh."

  content: They are a pain. Specially the ones where the "noise" has been increased
    to make it harder to read or even the letter at end is cut off. Simple few lines
    of php with 3+5=8 is sufficient. Not perfect, but reduce the spam.

  content: "I have found that ReCaptcha (recaptcha.net) works extremely well. The
    great thing about how it works is that the one word it displays (the one it actually
    uses to make sure you're not a robot) will have been correctly identified by 1000's
    of other users. I rarely make a mistake when entering one of their captcha's (which
    I do a lot), and I've found it to be very secure.\r\n\r\nAs for other captcha
    systems, I've lost count how many times I've been frustrated as well. I have given
    up many times to register for a site, just because their captcha is too difficult."

  content: Stew I hear you completely. However, if it's on a blog I'd look at trying
    to implement Akismet (akismet.com) as it's not only a Wordpress thing or if you
    really want a Captcha then I'd use recaptcha.net as they're more in alignment
    with accessibility guidelines - plus I generally am able to pass their tests :-)

    - just a bit of latency if you use it on your own site which is a small problem
    but for end-users it's the best Captcha technology IMO"

    with any of the entries you posted screenshots of above. I just think the team
    that implemented it on Register.com's WHOIS pages made some serious error."

    the red characters.

    This isn't a problem on one single site - it's a problem on numerous. I decided
    to blog it because I'm tired of fighting with a technology that clearly doesn't
    work for \"humans\".\r\n\r\nClearly you're pro the technology, I'm not convinced,
    particularly when it directly impacts on your ability to sell something to someone.
    It's just not good business sense irrespective of whether it prevents your site
    from being abused."

    When I enter something in a capcha and does not work on at least 3 consecutive
    retries, I quit doing it and leave the site.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion of capchas,:\r\n\r\nNOT
    GOOD : not working always as in your case.\r\n\r\nVERY GOOD : When it works, blocks
    spam and ill content better than Akismet.\r\n\r\nUse it, don't use it, up to you.\r\n\r\nFinal
    thoughts, Nothing beats personal moderation of comments. If you don't like what
    you see, DON'T approve."

  content: "I'm a web developer and have found captchas necessary to stop spam for
    my company and clients.\r\n\r\nMy solution for the sake of usability is to provide
    some form of \"refresh\" button next to the captcha.  Refresh all you want until
    you find one that you don't have trouble reading.\r\n\r\nNot to mention that I
    generally implement forms that use Javascript to validate them before they get
    submitted, so you get a much quicker response if you got it wrong instead of having
    to wait for the page to reload.\r\n\r\nCheck out the captcha on the contact form
    here on my site: http://titaniumwebsolutions.com/contact (click the send email
    link to open up the contact form).\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, this is how captchas
    should be implemented.  It's tough for bots to crack due to the wavy, crammed
    together letters and made more usable by letting users get a new one if they can't
    read the first one that loads with the form."

<blockquote>A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response test used in computing to ensure that the response is not generated by a computer. The process usually involves one computer (a server) asking a user to complete a simple test which the computer is able to generate and grade. Because other computers are unable to solve the CAPTCHA, any user entering a correct solution is presumed to be human. (via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">Wikipedia</a>)
</blockquote>
I really <strong>do</strong> consider myself an intelligent human being yet despite my own personal beliefs other websites simply don't agree. For a long time I've struggled with CAPTCHA's implemented on websites. Either I'm really dumb or the technology is flawed - I lean towards to later.
Let's look at my latest example. Last night I went to <a href="http://www.register.com">Register.com</a> to look for available domain names. Now I normally use <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a> for domain name <del datetime="2009-06-17T22:15:06+00:00">squatting</del> hunting but alas the last few days their search results have not been working properly so I decided to use the <em>other</em> giant.
When I tried to access the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">WHOIS</a> details for a particular domain I was presented with a CAPTCHA - I guess in an effort to determine if I was a robot or a real human being - but after twenty unsuccessful attempts I simply had to give up the challenge-response test and succumb to the notion that I must be a robot/spammer/computer and not human after all.
After the first ten or so failures I decided to screenshot all my responses to the CAPTCHA images presented to me because I have to prove to myself that I am not a robot by getting your help on the matter. Here are my results.
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2009/06/captcha-fuck-up.png" alt="Image" title="CAPTCHA FUCK UP!!!!!" />
Please can someone tell me where I went wrong.......?
The net-result is that Register.com will not be seeing any of my money any time soon and I can't tell you how often this exact thing happens with CAPTCHA. I realise why a site like Register.com uses it, GoDaddy uses it too, but surely it could be easier for <em>real people</em> to pass the challenge-response test?
In 2005 the W3C Working Group wrote a paper on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a> and there were some interesting findings. Most importantly they discovered that many of the CAPTCHA systems can be defeated by computers with between 88% and 100% accuracy and that all CAPTCHA effectively does is give site owners a false sense of security.
So if you implement a CAPTCHA system and are only able to achieve at best a 12% success rate in avoiding abuse of your system, then surely it's time to implement other human verification methods?
