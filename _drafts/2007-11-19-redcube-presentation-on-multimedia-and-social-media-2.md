<a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a> and I have just finished delivering a presentation to <a href="http://www.redcube.co.za">RedCube</a>, the PR agency behind Visa, on Multimedia and Social Media. Gregor took the first part of the presentation where he highlights what <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> is doing on a Multimedia level and also analyzes current global and local trends within in the Multimedia industry.
I took an in depth look at Social Media, Web 2.0 and the impact this has on PR agencies globally. There is an interesting case study I did on the <a href="http://www.fritolay.com/">Frito-Lay</a> PR department and how they utilised the Social Media sphere to promote the <a href="http://www.fritolay.com/fl/flstore/cgi-bin/products_doritos.htm">Doritos</a> chips brand among their core target market of 16-24 year olds. I also tried to look at what South African PR companies can do to further promote their clients' brands in the Social Media sphere.
The presentation, without the sexy Keynote effects and video we included, is embedded below.
