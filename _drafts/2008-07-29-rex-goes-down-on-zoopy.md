  content: It would be interesting to see what this graph would look like if you were
    to normalize the views to age of the video. Not saying you wouldn't still see

    Rex's views came in the first two days. The rest is just a trickle.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    I can't substantiate this with any concrete stats but maybe Jason can assist."
