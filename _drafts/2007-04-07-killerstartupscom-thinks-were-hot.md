The coverage of <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>, it would seem, doesn't stop within the African borders. I was notified via email on a few minutes ago that Afrigator had been reviewed at this unique website as the next big thing!
<a href="http://KillerStartups.com">KillerStartups.com</a> is intended for internet entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and CEOs of internet companies. They review around 20 startups per day and people vote for the internet startup they think will be a killer.
So, if you think we'll be a killer start-up head on over to <a href="http://www.killerstartups.com/UserGenContent/Afrigator--Africas-Talking-Are-You-Listening/">our review page</a> and click the killer button to vote for us!
