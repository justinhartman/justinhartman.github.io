  content: "Hey Justin\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback and apologies I am only getting
    back to you now.  Our new arrival has meant that I haven't been checking feeds
    and email much the last few days.\r\n\r\nI think my presentation was rushed in
    part because I started a little late.  That being said we realised that there
    is quite a bit of information packed into these topics and we are planning a longer
    event in the first half of next year where we will spend a lot more time discussing
    the legal issues that we touched on at our workshop.\r\n\r\nWe are also very happy
    to run seminars for companies that don't want to wait that long."

A week ago I was fortunate enough to attend the <a href="http://newmediaandtechnologylawatwork.pbwiki.com/">New Media and Technology law workshop</a> hosted by <a href="http://jacobson.co.za/">Paul Jacobson</a> and <a href="http://www.kachimobile.co.za">Daniella Kafouris</a>.
I was particularly excited about this workshop because I've had my fair share of legal <em>complications</em> over the last few years and I was keen to hear what the experts had to say.
Daniella went into great detail on how technology law implicates corporate business as well as SMEs and highlighted some important aspects in terms of company liability which I found particularly interesting. While I no longer own a business I can see the value of what Daniella was presenting in the workshop and this is a must for any Director or business owner.
Paul's take on New Media law was fantastic and he really gave a great overview on various new media topics and provided some insight I've previously not given much thought to. Some of what was discussed has a serious implication for <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za">The Times</a> so from this perspective alone I have to say the workshop was well worth it.
If you're new to the game or just lack the legal understanding - which most of us do - then this is a workshop you simply can not miss out on. I know there is another one planned in the next couple months so make sure you follow the <a href="http://newmediaandtechnologylawatwork.pbwiki.com/">wiki</a> for more info.
I only have two suggestions for both Paul and Daniella:
1. Limit questions to the end of each presentation. It was really nice to have interaction during the presentations however the net result was that Paul's presentation was rushed. Leaving questions for last would provide more value at the end of the day.
2. While this workshop was a great introduction to technology and new media law I'd like to see a more in depth workshop on these topics. I'd really like a whole day event where we can really delve deeper into these issues because for the layman things aren't 100% clear until you can really analyse things properly.
