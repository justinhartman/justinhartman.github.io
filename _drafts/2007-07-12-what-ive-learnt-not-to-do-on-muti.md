    EXACT same topic. As most of us know I am close to this subject and have blogged
    about it before. I think that you are right, we dealt with the issue a few months
    ago but now the site is growing and it seems like users are becoming complacent
    about their role on muti. \r\n\r\nUsers need to get sticky and get involved. Don't
    let people muti thier own content, vote them down and make a point. Don't vote
    down others to get yourself ahead and don't use fake usernames. Simple. 3 rules."

  content: "Nic well I must admit I'm pleased I beat you too it :) It certainly has
    increased but y suspicion is that it happens mostly because people don't realise
    that submitting you content is not so lekker. This was true for me until I read
    Rafiq's post in December so I understand it completely.\r\n\r\nDave you are 100%
    correct. Muti can and should be used for exactly this purpose and I find myself
    doing this all the time. It's weird but it works well. Multiple usernames simply
    defeat your own end goal!!!\r\n\r\nThe problem I guess with Muti is that people(bloggers)
    have egos and everyone would like to have the most \"Kudus\" or posts ranking
    in the \"Top 25\" and as long as this exists people will try cheat. It's just
    the way life works."

    your own site. Seems pretty feeble\r\n2. Voting your own stuff up.\r\n\r\nI disagree
    that people shouldnt be able to post their own content for 2 reason:\r\n\r\nA)
    The whole point of something like Muti, Reddit etc is for the community to decide
    what they think of a particular post. Its like submitting an artwork for a competition.
    You've put it out there so people need to vote on it.\r\n\r\nB) 90% of those sites
    on Muti don't have a real readership of more than a handful of readers (call it
    under 50 real readers). Realistically a big % of them are going to fall away over
    time. Those that survive and develop a following wont need Muti to promote and
    develop their community. But without something like Muti to kickstart it they
    will never get going...\r\n\r\nDunno those are just my thoughts."

  content: "Marc I hear what you are saying and agree to a point. I'm all for submitting
    \"some\" of your own content but I think it becomes a problem if you submit \"all\"
    of your content to muti. A site like Reddit also largely accepts self-posting
    but discourages spamming and I think there is a difference.\r\n\r\nUsers of Muti
    aren't going to hate it/you/or your blog if you submit your own stuff but the
    continual submission is something that affects everyone.\r\n\r\n90% of Muti is
    good articles and interesting to most users of Muti. If we opened it up and allowed
    everyone to submit their own content it would turn Muti into another blog aggregator
    and Muti simply isn't that. It's not why it exists and other services like Afrigator
    or Amatomu exist to give new blogs the kick-start they deserve in a hope to give
    bloggers a chance to be heard."

  content: Also remember that the guidelines are just that and are not hard and fast
    rules. There is no right or wrong thing to do but users of Muti do determine the
    social aspect of it and I'm almost positive than any new blog would hate it if
    the community frowned upon it and stopped visiting the blog. Surely this would
    kill any new blogs hope of ever succeeding?

    wrote an article on it a while back and how it actually still has some potential
    to be used as a business tool. A lot comes down to how the end user ultimately
    uses it. \r\n\r\nAs part of that media experiment we are currently running we
    are operating 10 blogs in totally different spheres. In all the time we've had
    those blogs I have not once visited either of the aggregators beyond signing up
    with them. I dont get them I'll be honest - its too many clicks for me to enjoy.\r\n\r\nMuti
    on the other hand - Submit my content. Poor stuff gets voted off the island and
    the top stuff you enjoy clicking through to because its 2 clicks and its whatever
    is topical at the moment.\r\n\r\nThis Post is a case in point. Now imagine you
    didn't have a following and nobody knew who Justin Hartman was. Why would they
    check your blog? I checked it because it was a hot topic on Muti. Nice and easy
    and simple."

  content: Look I run one of the aggregators and I can tell you we've got a lot of
    crap on there. It's the nature of aggregating content and for me thats why I still
    come back to Muti. I love the aggregators but it's more a main-stream function
    dealing with masses of content while a site like muti is simply picking the best
    of the best.

    media experiment is to find out:\r\n\r\nHow to develop a self sustaining on-line
    community and how to monetise it.\r\n\r\nSome interesting things have come out
    of it in the last few months but its part of helping us to understand whats happening
    with the Internet and hopefully be able to advise people around it as we go...\r\n\r\nThis
    is a good debate tho!"

  content: "Thanks for the pointers, I have submitted my own content in past and I
    see the the relative lack of worth in it, however I'm not convinced about the
    absolute lack of worth. The\"invisible hand\" (Dave) would want me to release
    news on behalf of a client, and kickstart it through self-submission. It needs
    a better peer review?\r\n\r\nSecondly, I'm for different personas. Many people
    have 3 basic personas: professional, social, family. To carry one persona online
    is therefore not being true to self. I dont want my client who is a CEO or company
    secretary to read my thoughts on politics or what I did on the weekend. I know
    many people in this community who have at least 2 blogs, and allowing personas
    allows whistleblowing and anonimity which is one of the pillars of the web"

  content: Look I run one of the aggregators and I can tell you we&#39;ve got a lot
    of crap on there. It&#39;s the nature of aggregating content and for me thats
    why I still come back to Muti. I love the aggregators but it&#39;s more a main-stream
    function dealing with masses of content while a site like muti is simply picking
    the best of the best.

  content: And to top it all off you get a <a href="http://www.submit-express.us/social.htm"
    rel="nofollow">site like this</a> which offers a paid for service in submitting
    your content to social bookmarking sites. I see muti isn&#39;t there yet but can
    you imagine the junk that will arrive if this service is extended to muti?

  content: ";-) I think its all part of an evolving Internet and not much you can
    do about it.<br><br>Thats part of what we&#39;ve been trying to achieve with this
    media experiment is to find out:<br><br>How to develop a self sustaining on-line
    community and how to monetise it.<br><br>Some interesting things have come out
    of it in the last few months but its part of helping us to understand whats happening
    with the Internet and hopefully be able to advise people around it as we go...<br><br>This
    is a good debate tho!"

  content: 'Thanks for the pointers, I have submitted my own content in past and I
    see the the relative lack of worth in it, however I&#39;m not convinced about
    the absolute lack of worth. The"invisible hand" (Dave) would want me to release
    news on behalf of a client, and kickstart it through self-submission. It needs
    a better peer review?<br><br>Secondly, I&#39;m for different personas. Many people
    have 3 basic personas: professional, social, family. To carry one persona online
    is therefore not being true to self. I dont want my client who is a CEO or company
    secretary to read my thoughts on politics or what I did on the weekend. I know
    many people in this community who have at least 2 blogs, and allowing personas
    allows whistleblowing and anonimity which is one of the pillars of the web'

I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://muti.co.za">Muti</a> which is a superb African Social Bookmark site where users can post links to content on the web. The site, based largely off <a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, has proven to be a great source of leading content within the African continent and generally what appears on Muti is worth the read.
The problem I'm seeing more and more, as the site grows larger and the readership increases, is that many people aren't aware of the unspoken guidelines that exist amongst users of Muti so I've decided to highlight some of them below. 
I must also add that I myself have broken most of these guidelines simply because I was ignorant at the time and didn't know any better. I'm hoping that this post will help the other ignorant people like myself.
<strong>Guideline 1: Avoid Submission Spam</strong>
<em>Submission Spamming</em> is different to conventional spamming simply because it may be quality content that is being posted to the site however when you submit every story from your own blog or website it is still considered spam.
<a href="http://www.webaddict.co.za/2006/12/17/muti-rule-dont-add-your-own-stuff/">Rafiq</a> has posted a good article on his blog about <a href="http://www.webaddict.co.za/2006/12/17/muti-rule-dont-add-your-own-stuff/">why you shouldn't submit your own content</a> and he provides some assistance on how to get your readers to do this for you.
<strong>Guideline 2: Don't submit content under a different username</strong>
This is similar to the above mentioned guideline however it's much more dirty as people submitting their own content under a different username are blatantly acting in submission spam. Muti is really about relevance and quality and submission spam, on whatever level, is just going against all of the principals of the site.
At some point regular users will figure out who's submitting relevant items and who's just spamming the site and it has an effect on your site as people simply won't visit it. We have <a href="http://amatomu.com">various</a> <a href="http://afrigator.com">aggregators</a> that will drive traffic to your site and Muti shouldn't be used in the same way.
<strong>Guideline 3: Don't vote against a story to get a higher ranking</strong>
One of the big features of Muti is the voting for or against a content item which in turn ranks the content against other votes on the site. A tactic with some is to give a negative vote on all articles that appear directly above your post in an attempt to make the <a href="http://www.muti.co.za/hot">Hot list</a> on Muti. Users of Muti vote for an article because of its merit and this helps maintain relevance for the users of the site so don't blatantly ruin it for people.
I know that Neville has done some good work on trying to eliminate this completely and as a result you can only vote on an item once which has certainly helped. To combat this even further though I'd like to suggest making it possible to see who's voting for or against which stories. Once people realise they could be caught I think you'll see the end of this completely.
