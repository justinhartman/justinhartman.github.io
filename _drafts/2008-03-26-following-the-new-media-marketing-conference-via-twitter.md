If you're attending today's New Media Marketing conference and are planning to Twitter from the event then I'd like to suggest that you all use <a href="http://hashtags.org/">Hashtags</a> in your twitter posts.
<blockquote>Hashtags are a community-driven convention for adding additional context and metadata to your tweets. They're like tags on Flickr, only added inline to your post. You create a hashtag simply by prefixing a word with a hash symbol: #hashtag.
</blockquote>
Using hashtags will not only enable better twitter following for the event but it will also allow users who are not attending the conference the opportunity to watch the events unfold and using hashtags is really simple.
1. You'll need to follow hashtags on Twitter so that hashtags can pick your tweets up. <a href="http://twitter.com/hashtags">Visit the hashtags user</a> and click follow.
2. When you tweet from the event add <strong>#newmedia08</strong> to your tweet so that hashtags picks your tweet up.
When you tweet with <strong>#newmedia08</strong> in your post it will automatically <a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/newmedia08/">appear on the newmedia08 hashtags page</a> which any user can follow.
Let's try it out and see how successful hashtags could be.
