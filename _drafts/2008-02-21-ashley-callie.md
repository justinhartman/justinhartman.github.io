I've developed this strange sentimental obsession with <a href="http://www.ashleycallie.co.za">Ashely Callie</a> since I learned of her <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=707399">death</a> last week. I have to be honest, I've never felt so emotional about the death of someone I've never met or even seen in real life before so overall I'm quite perplexed as to why I feel the way I do.
I used to be an <a href="http://www.isidingo.co.za/">Isidingo</a> fan-boy and I honestly believe that Robert Whitehead who plays Barker, Jack Devnarain who plays Rajesh and of course Ashley Callie carried Isidingo to the fame it is today. These three actors have been vital to the success of the show and I guess this is why I feel such a strong connection with Callie.
Ashley struck me as such an amazing woman and I am still shocked by the whole thing. It's sad but life goes on.
