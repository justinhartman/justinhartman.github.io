If you missed it then you seriously lost out. At around 12:00 on Wednesday morning the snow started to fall in Johannesburg for the first time in around 26 years. In fact the last time I saw snow in Johannesburg I was only 2 years old.
With the downfall of the snow I managed to capture three really cool videos. They've been uploaded to <a href="http://www.twac.tv">Twac</a> and I've included the final video below so you can see just how thick it came down.

There is also more. Here are the links to the three different clips taken at almost half hour intervals:
<strong><a href="http://www.twac.tv/view_video.php?viewkey=fa04aaf37f137a1d9d3e">Snowfall Part One - 12:05</a></strong>
<strong><a href="http://www.twac.tv/view_video.php?viewkey=4aa3ad78bdd6b366cc17">Snowfall Part Two - 12:30</a></strong>
<strong><a href="http://www.twac.tv/view_video.php?viewkey=5b314a80bdcb024f8e42">Snowfall Part Three - 01:05</a></strong>
You can also view some pictures I took of the snowfall <a href="/photos/#album=snow-27-june-2007">by visiting this link</a>.
WOW - what fun this was, if not a little cold!!!
