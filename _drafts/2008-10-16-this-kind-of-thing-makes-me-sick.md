  content: What on earth is the point of doing a thing like that? I mean, organised
    bigotry at least stands up for itself (just look at the GOP) and can be openly
    criticised. But this is just cowardice and gross stupidity. It makes me wonder
    about the "wisdom" of the crowds. Sigh.

    this.\r\n\r\n@Alistair I'm a big believer in the power of the community and wisdom
    of the crowds but at the end of the day there is little you can do about this
    level of hatred. I've seen a lot of this come out in the past on different platforms
    but this is the first I've seen on a local social media site like Muti.\r\n\r\nThere
    is just no room for this kind of crap anymore."

    downside, and the above is a perfect example. However I do think the domain owners
    should at least have some sort of method of removing and or punish users against
    using such derogatory terms.\r\n\r\nIt's disgusting though..."

  content: Ah I've seen stuff like this before on local platforms. It is not Muti's
    fault really... but things can be done to counter such activity. Things like VALID
    EMAIL ADDRESSES! Make one's Muti account worth something. Neville has done a great
    job thus far, but people will always do crappy things, just cus they can... end
    of story.

    fault, but what I don't get is why others are allowed to tag your posts in the
    first place and why anonymous submissions are allowed."

Picked this up on Muti only moments ago. Read the tag highlighted in blue.

To be honest I just have no time for people like this. It's disgraceful, inhumane and shows a total disrespect for human life. I know we live in a culture that still breeds this type of racism but really... doing this in a public forum is just not on.
Sick...
