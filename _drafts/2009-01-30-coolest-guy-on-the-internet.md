  content: "Herman I agree with your logic and nice article. The problem I have with
    any form of SEO is that it can be somewhat irrelevant. The bottom line is if you
    write original content, have a site that generates enough original content, you
    will generally rank higher in Google.\r\n\r\nThe whole point with Google is that
    they are continuously trying to improve their algorithms to prevent SEO experts
    from manipulating the results. \r\n\r\nI am a firm believer in the best content
    and rankings come organically and not from manipulation. But, that's just my point
    of view."

    guy on the Internet would have to own a Wii though, cos all the cool guys do,
    don't they? Hmmmm\r\n\r\nSilicon Valley, naaaaah, I duno, don't think that would
    be somewhere that I'd like to go, too much geek talk, I get enough of that as
    it is. Maritius sounded way cooler, but then again, it would be easier for a boss
    to accept a trip to Silicon Valley over Maritius!"

  content: Hey guys check the final update in the blog post above. Not a happy sight
    :(
---
I'm on a search to find the <a href="/2009/01/30/coolest-guy-on-the-internet/"><strong>coolest guy on the Internet</strong></a>. The reasons why I'm looking for this person will be revealed in due course but for now let me highlight a few of my favourites.
<a href="http://ramboguy.co.za/">Vernon Koekemoer</a> became the most popular person on the Internet by far. At first this guy seemed like a massive joke but now Vernon is featured in television adverts all over South Africa. Straight outta Benoni into web celebrity status.
The all time classic though has to be Bolton Deventer. Bolton captured our imagination with his SEO skills and web traffic tips and occasionally we were graced with the presence of his ever loving wife - Barbara. While Bolton only managed to survive for about 7 days on the web he was and will always be a legend in our time. Visit <a href="http://webtrafficmaker.wordpress.com/">Bolton's site here</a> if you've never had the chance to meet him before.
It is impossible to know who the next big thing will be but if Bolton and Vernon have taught us anything it's that celebrities online are needed as much as they are in real life.
In the meantime though I've found a real gem on YouTube. Does this chap take the cake or do you think that someone else belongs on this list. Please let me know in the comment form below! 
The search is on and may the best man win. Enjoy the video!

Update: have you guys seen this <a href="http://coolestguyontheinternet.net/">coolest guy</a> website?
<strong>FINAL UPDATE: Competition is over. I got beaten to the draw and even despite now ranking #1 and #2 respectively for the coolest guy on the Internet I'm afraid to say it's too little too late.</strong>
