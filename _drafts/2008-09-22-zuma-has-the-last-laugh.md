  content: Revenge was definitely the motivation behind the decision for sure. At
    the end of the day though, whats done is done, and the truth will one day show.
    I don't think Zuma is innocent, and I am sure that Nicholson was paid off, but
    thats just the way I see it.

  content: Mbeki was indeed a clown, but Zuma is definitely a few notches up the bozo
    ladder from him. I think I agree with everyone who has commented.. I just wish
    there was something ordinary people could be doing to work towards fixing this
    situation before things become desperate.

  content: "I agree with you that Mbeki had to go, however, I can't see the possibility
    of Zuma replacing him as a good thing at all - so I agree with you there. In a
    time of political turmoil you need a solid leader - and Zuma hardly qualifies.
    \r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I think the word clown suits him better than it suits
    Mbeki, he's already demonstrated an immense lack of thought on numerous occasions
    (a shower to prevent AIDS anyone?)\r\n\r\nI sortof echo Byron's comment about
    the pay-off - the numerous members of the ANC that commented seemed a little bit
    \"too sure\" about what the decision would be - all that talk about Nicholson
    \"looking sober\" and \"they're sure he'll make the right decision.\" I smell
    a sewer full of rats.\r\n\r\nAnd Nicholson's comments about conspiracies? That
    was irresponsible of a senior judge, considering the current political climate.\r\n\r\nLast
    thing I agree with you on - I hate Zuma too."

  content: "Just a correction ... Zuma has not been acquitted of fraud or corruption.
    The charges were dismissed which means that he is not \"not guilty\". It does
    leave the door open, implausible as it will be with a Zuma government, of charges
    being reinstated!\r\n\r\nBut why is Zuma that bad? I mean, he thought a shower
    protected him from HIV, that is one up on Mbeki who barely believed it existed!
    He recognises that there is/was a problem in Zimbabwe, that is one up on Mbeki
    who denied there is/was a problem! He acknowledges there is a crime problem, which
    is one up on Mbeki who said \"what crime problem, I have never been a victim of
    crime\". Yes, he is corrupt, but so is Mbeki and the entire ANC elite!\r\n\r\nThink
    what benefits we will get out of a Zuma regime: a new Minister of Health (probably
    Nosizwe Routledge, remember how everyone cried murder after Mbeki sacked her for
    doing the right thing?), we will also get rid of those idiots in Cabinet like
    Alec Irwin, Charles Nckula and Essop Pahad! Also, think of it this way, how many
    African countries actually have a change of leadership where the incumbent doesn't
    get his way?"

    it be irresponsible? The nature of Zuma's claim to the court was based on a political
    conspiracy - of course the judge had to comment on it since this is the question
    he was asked! He was not ruling on Zuma's guilt or innocence but rather on the
    procedural point of whether the correct procedure was carried out by the NPA.
    When Zuma asked the court to review it he cited a political conspiracy as the
    motive for the NPA not following the procedures as set out by law. Thus Nicholson
    was obliged to answer that question in his judgment!"

    policies, or lack of them - he's cosied up to so many people both locally and
    overseas even he must be confused as to where he stands.\r\n\r\nFrom my point
    of view, the problem is quite obviously the following: \r\n1. his mental capacity
    and lack of basic education \r\n2. corruption charges leveled against him that
    he has not be cleared of\r\n3. more importantly, the image this presents to the
    rest of the world and the effect it will have on our international relations\r\n\r\nWhere
    Mbeki at least managed to present some kind of statesmanlike image, Zuma comes
    across to the average 1st world citizen as a backward, belligerent and wilfully
    ignorant criminal."

  content: "\"...of course the judge had to comment on it since this is the question
    he was asked!\"\r\n\r\nNo ... the question asked was whether the charges against
    Zuma had followed correct procedure, which they hadn't - and in this case his
    judgement was correct.\r\n\r\nHowever, he then went one step further and started
    theorising about conspiracies - that wasn't part of his mandate as far as I was
    concerned - and he specifically implicated Mbeki, which gave the ANC all the ammunition
    they needed to get rid of him. None of this had been proven or even investigated
    - all we've had so far are wild utterances by JZ's crowd, not to mention that
    loudmouthed idiot Malema.\r\n\r\nStop for a moment and think of the image our
    country is presenting to the rest of the world right now ... these are days where
    I can be seriously ashamed of calling myself South African."

    issues as well and I agree that Mbeki had flaws but presented himself as a \"good\"

    political skills and etiquette.\r\n\r\nI think both you and J Hayes are correct
    in the concern over how we are perceived by the rest of the world. This is a BIG
    concern but at the same time I'm more worried over the state of the nation and

  content: "You have not read the judgment. I did and it took me a long time - it
    is a very long judgment. Arguing that the procedure has not been followed is only
    one step, it doesn't get the charges withdrawn unless you can show that your rights
    have been violated. In order to show that his rights had been violated Zuma had
    to show some sort of conspiracy (not necessarily a political one) since if he
    did not there was no motif for the NPA and the court would just have ordered the
    NPA to allow Zuma to make the representations that he was not allowed in the first
    place. The judgment is clear, that the procedure had not been followed and that
    this violated Zuma's right since there was a motif for the NPA to do this! If
    he did not refer to the conspiracy question then Nicholson's judgment would have
    been moot.\r\n\r\nIn terms of South Africa's image abroad? Well I will tell you
    since I live and work abroad and the image is positive ... there is a change of
    leadership as a result of a leader (Mbeki) being help accountable by the electorate
    in an African country! Wouldn't it have been nice for Zanu-PF to have done the
    same with Mugabe? Or wouldn't it have been nice for this to happen to Charles
    Taylor, or Hosnei Mubarak? Who replaces him is a separate issue, lets see what
    Zuma is actually like! I mean George Bush was very popular before 911, so was
    Tony Blair! Really, what I am saying is lets give the guy a chance before we try
    to bring him down!"

    all know that Zuma is guilty, we don't need a court to tell us that. On the other
    hand we all know that the arms deal was the most corrupt deal ever in this country.
    We all know that half (actually all) the cabinet took bribes, so does this invalidate
    the candidacy of the entire government for the presidency?\r\n\r\n\"3. more importantly,

    of the Western world as a failure!"

  content: "@Luke\r\n\r\nYou implied that education was a necessary condition for
    good leadership by saying that his lack of basic education is a \"problem\". My
    example of George Bush, who is incredibly well educated indicates that education
    is not a necessary, nor sufficient condition for good leadership. In fact, history
    shows that a good education is not a pre-condition for good leadership, lets throw
    out two recent examples:\r\n\r\nGeorge Bush, MBA (Yale - top 10 global university)\r\nRobert
    Mugabe, 7 degrees including from Oxford, London and UNISA\r\n\r\nI was not implying
    that Bush has normal mental capacity or has been a good leader, in fact I was
    implying that he has been a very poor leader, as represented by his unpopularity
    in his own country (yes, he is very, very unpopular in the US). So just because
    a person is poorly educated it does not mean they will be a poor leader. Trevor
    Manuel and Tito Mboweni have no education in economics or finance yet they both
    have been recognised as being good leaders in their fields! Performance in government
    in South Africa is actually negatively correlated with education - the most successful
    government ministers have actually been the ones with the least education. I am
    not implying that one has to be poorly educated to succeed in government, what
    I am saying is that one should not assume that there is a correlation between
    education and leadership, or even intelligence and leadership!"

The big news of the weekend is <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=848203">the resignation</a> of Thabo Mbeki and I can't help but feel that Zuma is sitting with a God-forsaken smile on his face right now at the irony of how he's finally got his revenge.
I don't think even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapiro">Zapiro</a> realised just how pertinent his cartoon of <a href="http://multimedia.thetimes.co.za/audio/2008/09/zapiro-wont-apologise/">Zuma raping the justice system</a> (below) would be in the days leading after its publication in the Sunday Times.
<a href="/assets/images/uploads/2008/09/0000124445.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/09/0000124445.jpg" alt="Jacob Zuma Raping the Justice System" title="Jacob Zuma Raping the Justice System" width="500" height="301" class="size-full wp-image-303" /></a>
Our acquitted rapist, fraudster and down right dimwit has successfully managed to escape any prosecution and in turn flip the whole political situation on its head by having the ANC recall Mbeki. I guess it's a case of <em>he who laughs last</em>?
I'll state this outright - <strong>I hate Zuma</strong> and I despise anyone who supports him however, I do think this new political turmoil is very much needed in a country that has lived far too long under Mbeki's denialist regime.
Mbeki is a clown. HIV/Aids never existed, Mugabe was never the problem in Zimbabwe and crime in our country was never an issue. These are just some of his insane beliefs we've been subjected to over the last few years and I'm happy we've seen the end of it.
While I really think Mbeki being ousted is a positive thing I'm deeply concerned about where we go to from here. I have no faith in Zuma or his political allies and I can't see how the new regime is going to be any better - in fact, I think it's going to get worse.
Overall I have to say these are <em>troubled</em> and <em>uncertain</em> times and I'm watching the political space in trepidation of what will happen next.
