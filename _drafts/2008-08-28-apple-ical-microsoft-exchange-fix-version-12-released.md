<strong>Installing</strong>
If you've never installed this fix before then please read the detailed installation instructions <a href="/2008/03/31/apple-ical-microsoft-exchange-fix-for-leopard/">found over here</a>. If you're upgrading from a previous version please read the detailed upgrade notes below.
<strong>Upgrading from version 1.1</strong>
1. Delete the folder <strong>/Applications/iCalFix/</strong> in Finder.

2. Download this <a href="/ccount/click.php?id=3">Upgrade Script</a> to your computer and extract the contents from the ZIP file. The folder contains a Shell script (install.sh) which sets everything up for you.

3. Right-click on the <strong>install.sh</strong> file, select <em>Open With</em> and then click on <em>Other</em>.

6. You can now check if the bug fix was installed correctly by navigating to <strong>/Applications/iCalFix/</strong> in Finder. If you see two files installed in that folder then installation was successful.
