Yesterday I wrote a post called <strong><a href="/2007/10/15/using-social-media-to-track-the-mondli-arrest/">Using Social Media to track the Mondli arrest</a></strong> which highlighted my efforts in setting up Jaiku to aggregate what's been written about in the Mondli Makhanya affair.
Within hours I stumbled upon the follow two websites.
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/10/cloning1.png' alt='Website Clone' />
<img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/10/cloning2.png' alt='Website Clone' />
Now this kind of thing is happening almost every single time I post a new item and it's really pissing me off. Not only is my content being scraped but I'm sure this is having an effect on my Google rank? The only good thing about these above-two sites is that they've swapped the order of  the words in my heading around so it almost looks unique but still......
I have to figure out a way to stop this but I just don't know how.
