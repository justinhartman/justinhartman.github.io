  content: My father lives and works in Lagos, and he has for the last 8 years. He
    lives on Victoria Island and Works on Ikoyi island. I have been there 3 times
    and I would have to agree, it is an adventure that everyone should experience.
    Nigeria has been given a bad name by immigrants when in fact its actually a beautiful
    country with very friendly people (some just friendly for money though). I have
    some hilarious pictures I can pass on to you if you want. My favorite pic is one
    of 3 men on an okada (125cc motorcylce) and all 3 of them are holding onto a huge
    propane tank under their arms doing about 100km/h on the highway.

  content: Jahnza - it is a sadly misunderstood country which has been sterotyped
    considerably. Look, there are scammers all over the place but my experience of
    Nigerians in Lagos was only pleasant. It was without doubt not what I expected
    (in a positive way)

    Degrees North, Bacchus, News Cafe, etc. \r\n\r\nI'll be back soon and often. :)"

    peaceful place. Nairobi is quite far from the Coast where I'm at although you
    can always take a detour. Karibu.\r\n\r\nI've not been to Lagos or SA but they're
    both now in my bucket list. \r\n\r\nNairobi is the same as Lagos it seems. You
    don't want to walk around alone but with a local it's safe. Someone who can tell
    you which corners not to venture into. I guess in many a foreign city that's the
    general rule."

Lagos is an adventure that I maintain any African should experience at least once in their lifetime. Lagos reminds me of one really big township and it has a real sense of adventure about it. This photo was taken while driving and depicts a typical scene of what street life is like in Nigeria. You can buy anything from vegetables to recharge vouchers for your mobile phone and on the streets everything is dirt cheap. I have to admit it's not a city that one really wants to walk around in by oneself but if you're with a local it's pretty safe to do so.
Over the coming days/weeks I'm going to be posting a series of photos I took while I spent some time in Lagos. I know that everything in Lagos was an experience to me and I hope that some of the photos will help depict that experience to you.
