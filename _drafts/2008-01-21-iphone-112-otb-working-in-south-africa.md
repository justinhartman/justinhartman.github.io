After seeing <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/2007/11/26/why-i-bought-an-iphone/">Colin's iPhone working</a> in SA I decided to buy one myself. The only issue is that all the new iPhones shipped with version 1.1.2 firmware on it can be hacked but there is no way to unlock the SIM card feature on these new versions. This means that instead of having a fancy new phone I ended up with a glorified iPod.
The good news however is that I managed to get a SIM from overseas that un-bricks my iPhone and now I have a fully functional iPhone working on the Vodacom network. (More details on this to follow)
