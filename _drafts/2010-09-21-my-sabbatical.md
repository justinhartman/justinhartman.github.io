<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2010/09/images.jpeg" alt="Image" title="Sabbatical" width="259" height="194" class="alignright size-full wp-image-953" />On Thursday myself and <a href="http://gregorrohrig.com">Gregor Rohrig</a> are off on a two-week trip to the United States. We'll be in New York to attend the <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/webexny2010/">Web 2.0 conference</a> and then we're headed off to San Francisco to meet some interesting industry folks, including the <a href="http://www.yola.com">Yola</a> team.
Initially I just wanted to go to attend the conference but as time draws nearer I realise that my trip to the US is going to be a much needed sabbatical from the events of 2010. Over the last few months it has become clear to me that the <a href="/2010/05/19/in-loving-memory-rodney-john-hartman-25021949-19052010/">loss of my father</a> has had a much bigger impact on my life than I realised. I've also had a number of personal issues which have really played a major part in defining where I am at today.
The result of all of this is that not only has my personal life been affected but so has my business life. I have an inbox that looks like a sick spam joke and my communication of late has been appalling. This has not been how I wanted to deal with the world but life sometimes has other ideas for us.
Right now I'm focusing my effort on getting myself back on track. I have been spreading myself way to thin over all the business ventures I'm involved in and I need to focus on my personal well being in order to fix the mess both personally and professionally.
Life is not easy and being an entrepreneur even less. I've learned some very difficult lessons of late but lessons they have been and I hope to rectify the wrong-doing over time.
So, for the next two weeks I won't really be bothering too much about work. I need this time to reflect and enjoy my time in the US and I know that <a href="http://stii.co.za">Stii</a> will sort out all the Afrigator issues in my absence. 
I look forward to returning and feeling like I can take on the world again. Right now that isn't so true for me.
