  content: "I can't give you much advice as I am not a parent but I can tell you that
    I went under a few times before I was 5. Relatively (hehehe) I am perfectly fine
    although some may argue otherwise. \r\n\r\nHad my tonsils removed at 3 and about
    3 other surgeries and all went off without a hitch. \r\n\r\nSo I think that as
    warrented as your concern is, things will generally work out perfectly. If the
    doctors involved thought it would be a problem they would never suggest the surgery.
    \r\n\r\nHave you been for a second opinion?"

    I guess the issue here is letting go of control and when it comes to my son's
    safety this is difficult for me to do.\r\n\r\nI haven't been for a second opinion
    because of cost... I already need to pay in like R2500 because medical aid don't
    cover all of it."

  content: Yeah man its a tough issue. I know exactly how you feel as Ian was about
    4 when he had to get grommets. He came through it without any side effects and
    today we're happy we did it as he would have stayed sick and in pain constantly
    if we had not done it. Sometimes you just have to do what you think is best and
    hope and trust all will be okay. I cannot tell you nothing will go wrong, but
    there is on the flip side also no guarantees that something will go wrong.

    and i'm fine. I had around 7 before i was 5 and the only side affect I had was
    nausea which was and still remains a bad after affect.\r\n\r\nGood luck, i'm sure
    he will be fine though - anesthetist's are very thorough in their pre-op exams
    and they wont sedate if they are concerned about something."

  content: Hi Justin, my heart bleeds for you and your wife.  One correction though
    - Ian was 8 months when he had his grommets put in (thanks Stii for noticing that
    ...)  Taking him into the ops room was quite a scary experience (please I don't
    want to scare you, but rather prepare you).  Ian had to sit on my lap whilst they
    were giving him anesthesia. They didn't use a mask, only held the little pipe
    that's blowing out the anesthesia in front of his nose/mouth area.  Of course
    I felt like I on a high after a while.  The worst feeling was the moment that
    you have to hand over that little body, your most precious possession ever, into
    the hands of a person you don't really know. And all these awful thoughts come
    rushing through your mind. But everything worked out very well and when he woke
    up, he was very grumpy - cried a bit, but the moment he got hold of his dummy
    and "doek", he was fine and fell asleep again.  The doctors know exactly what
    they're doing and would not put your child's life in danger.  It does ease one's
    mind thinking that a professional anesthetist will be doing the most dangerous
    part of the job, and they know exactly what they are doing, and especially with
    kids - they are so much more carefull. All I can say is have faith in the people
    around you, the doctors and God.  Good luck and let us know how everything worked
    out.  We will be thinking of you 3.

  content: "Hi Justin, \r\n\r\nMy daughter had about 30 hours of anesthesia before
    she turned 3, and I was petrified. One of the complications can be the loss of
    short term memory, which I thought was a horrific consequence. Luckily, even after
    all that anesthesia, she is completely fine and there are no side effects what
    so ever. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am very weary of putting her through any further procedure
    that requires anesthesia, unless it is ABSOLUTELY necessary. Earlier this year
    I caused huge havoc at the hospital where I refused consent for anesthesia, because
    I felt the options of a sedative were not explored enough. As it happened, a sedative
    turned out to be more than adequate.   So my advice to you is this: 1) Anesthesia
    for young kids is something they can overcome easily 2) Follow your gut."

Ok I need help. A few weeks back we took Luke, my son, to the dentist. Apparently he suffers from the Hartman "weak-teeth" curse and now he needs some work done to some of his molar teeth.
The problem is this work can't be done in the chair and the dentist has advised that we do this under general anaesthetic. We could barely get him to sit in the chair for the preliminary consultation to the Dentist so in my mind this does seem like the only way to resolve this issue.
That said I am crapping myself. This is the first time that I as a parent am faced with a really difficult decision and I'm lost for the right answer. On the one hand I know if we don't resolve this now he'll end up with teeth problems for the rest of his life but on the other hand I'm so worried that something goes wrong and I jeopardize his life as a direct result of this anaesthetic.
Luke is scheduled for this operation on Wednesday morning and I'm really getting the pre-op jitters.
Does anyone have any advice for me?
