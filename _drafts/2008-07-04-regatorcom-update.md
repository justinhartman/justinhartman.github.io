Earlier today I <a href="/2008/07/04/regatorcom-steals-our-brand-coincidence/">posted this</a> in which I argued that <a href="http://regator.com">Regator</a> may have stolen <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a>'s brand.
I have to say that while Regator has certain elements that share a close resemblance to us I'm of the opinion that Scott and his team did not do this maliciously as I had initially suspected. 
I was fortunate enough to have a discussion with Scott Lockhart (co-founder) via email where he assured me that they had not even heard of Afrigator until today. He also gave me access to the Regator beta website and I've gone through it extensively.
Having spoken candidly with Scott and seeing what Regator is all about I'm convinced this was simply a coincidence. If anything, Regator is a mashup of a content aggregator with Digg/Reddit style bookmarking functionality and I can now see that when Regator goes live there will be little confusion between our two respective sites.
I wish Scott and his team all the best with their new venture. It's a tough market but they're off to a great start.
