  content: Well done Team Afrigator. Remember though, that if someone uses that code,
    REGARDLESS of where they live or what address they put in, the tshirt will get
    delivered to your office the next day.

According to <a href="http://www.springleap.com">Springleap</a>, <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> has been selected as one of the <a href="http://www.springleap.com/posts/view/top100-go-moto">100 trendiest companies</a> in Cape Town.
What's cool about this though is that we're in the list with Ogilvy, Jupiter, Young & Rubicam, Vodacom and Investec to name but a few. I wonder though if Springleap have seen our offices yet?
That said, our company has been given a 25% discount coupon to use on Springleap and if you'd like to T from them just use <strong>AFRIGATOR</strong> as the coupon code when purchasing.
