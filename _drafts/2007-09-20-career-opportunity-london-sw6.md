<ul>
<li>Could you manage a football team with only a measly &Acirc;&pound;500m budget?
<li>Have you got the stamina to sign cheques morning, noon and night for any player you want?
<li>Can you sulk in a sickening manner whenever referees don't award you five penalties every game?
<li>Are you capable of spouting utter nonsense at press meetings?
<li>Can you say 'Yes sir, of course sir!' whenever your boss makes a suggestion, however unhelpful?
</ul>
<strong>Yes?</strong>
Then come to Stamford Bridge!
