I normally wouldn't blog about an update to a plugin I'm working on but I've just released version 1.3 of the <a href="http://timesurl.at/plugins/sociable.php">TimesURL Sociable Plugin for WordPress</a>.
If you've never heard of this plugin before here's a quick excerpt detailing what the plugin is all about.
<blockquote>The TimesURL Sociable Plugin for WordPress gives visitors the ability to shorten urls, email, and share pages they find on your website. It works by adding icon images below each of your blog posts that, when clicked, sends your blog post details to a range of South African and International social bookmarking websites.
</blockquote>
The plugin has matured somewhat and this important update forms part of a new structure which we've implemented to work with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">WordPress plugin directory</a>.
While there was an automatic update function in this plugin what I found was that WordPress' built-in plugin update notifications only work with plugins that are contained within the WordPress plugin directory.
Version 1.3 is now compatible for use with the plugin directory and I urge anyone using this plugin to upgrade as soon as possible so that you can be notified as soon as newer versions of the plugin are available. Detailed upgrade instructions are contained within the readme.txt file.
I've also added a couple more South African sites for you to chose from.
