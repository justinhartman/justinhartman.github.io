  content: Hats off to you guys.  I think you've done a world-class job.  There's
    a lot to be said for garage-setups, as these normally are the outfits that people
    put their hearts and souls into (and it tells), as opposed to large corporate
    jobs which might be slick but can much easier lose impetus when key people move
    in.

<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_international_products_2008.php"><img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/12/150-red-star.jpg" alt="Image" title="150-red-star" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-449" /></a>This almost went unnoticed but on Friday <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> was voted one of the <strong>Top 10 International Products for 2008</strong> by <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_10_international_products_2008.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>. This is obviously a massive accolade for all of us involved in Afrigator and at times like this I'm left perplexed at how a small <em>garage startup</em> like Afrigator has managed to gain such credibility outside the borders of SA.
To be included in the list along with massive properties like <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> and <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> is a great testament to the efforts the guys have put into this company and I was particularly chuffed to see that this article made the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2008/12/05/05readwriteweb-top_10_international_products_2008.html">New York Times' Technology</a> section.

Now all we need to do is figure out how we can get similar local recognition and then we're well and truly sorted!
