  content: Hey Justin, bit confused here - you call it a silly game, and then proceed
    to tag me? Not sure whether to thank you or deride you. Will give you the benefit
    of the doubt and say thanks... for making me get way too personal on my blog.
    :) Just kidding, thanks for the tag. Still owe you a lunch.

    along I had to find some unsuspecting victims to get more info from and you're
    on my list!"

    what was I saying again?\r\n\r\nSleep with one eye open, dude! Don't think I gave
    away any really useful info though, so seems I may have to keep my spot on the
    list for a while  :)"

Thanks to Mike for <a href="http://www.mikestopforth.com/2008/01/04/8-things/">tagging me</a> in this silly game I now find myself writing 8 things you didn't know about me. In principal I hate this kind of crap but I'll give it a bash...
1. I'm the eldest of 4 children. I have two brothers, Oliver (22) and Scott (16) as well as a very young Sister, Emma (8).
2. In nursery school I kissed my first girl only to have the entire school belittle and sing the classic "k-i-s-s-i-n-g" song. Very traumatising.
3. I've been hit twice by a car while driving my bicycle to school. No apparent long-term side-effects just yet!
4. I was a DJ. Not very successful but relatively good and I played at <a href="http://www.flys.com/">Black Flys</a> parties as well as clubs like <em>The Foundation</em>, <em>Stonewater</em> and more.
5. When DJ'ing didn't work out I decided that I want to help people. I studied to become a counselor and got my first job in a chemical dependency rehab soon after. I lasted 3 months before I had a nervous break-down and decided people could help themselves!
6. My parents are both Journalists and growing up I vowed that I'd never become one. Now I work at a daily newspaper and have had most of my work experience in the Media industry.
7. I have a very unique IQ (not particularly high) of which 0.06% of the global population share with me. I'm quite proud of this - makes me feel special.
8. I'm a fanatical <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/index.asp">Arsenal</a> fan and I try visit London once a year to watch my team play.
Now I'll tag the following people:
