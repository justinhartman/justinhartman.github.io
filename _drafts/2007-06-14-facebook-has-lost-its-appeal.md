    a FB app invite" I still believe in this Facebook thingie. Give it a month and
    those stupid little invites will be gone and they'll be on to something even more
    groundbreaking. They're good at that type of thing.

  content: "Gino I couldn't agree more. There is value in Facebook and it's success/effectiveness
    is amazing. Just look at its growth rate and that's all the evidence you need.
    My concern with this latest development is that ultimately Facebook will lose
    its effectiveness. They're changing their focus and I'm not sure it's a good thing.\r\n\r\nI
    was thinking last night what made Google great and it was simply the fact that
    they did one thing right (search) and could then build off of that. That said
    though they have still never lost sight of search as a medium and they've never
    changed this focus.\r\n\r\nI think Facebook is changing their stance as they develop
    into this superpower which may or may not work."

Facebook is the <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> of Social Networking sites and it's clean and fresh approach has held the key to its success. I see evidence of this simplicity when friends of mine, who don't even own computers, have a Facebook profile.
Facebook Apps however is changing the very focus of this simplicity and I've noticed a huge influx of requests for me to add various third-party applications to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=566420412">my profile</a>. It is clear that Zuckerman and his company have probably more than doubled their market value by allowing companies to integrate with Facebook but I think from an end-user's perspective it's a bad move.
Since these horrible requests started streaming in (see pic) I've found myself using Facebook less and less and while I'm not a conventional user of Facebook I feel it's lost its value for me.
I think that like <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, Facebook will become a thing of past for me.
