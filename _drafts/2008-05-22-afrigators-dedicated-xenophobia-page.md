  content: Hi Justin, having been born and bred in Zimbabwe until i came to varsity
    in Cape Town 8 years ago, I feel incredibly strongly about the xenophobic attacks.
    So when someone stands up to be counted to fight such things, I take my hat off
    to you as a South African. (huge added bonus it's on Afrigator, something I support
    daily) So thank you, and well done!

  content: "Thanks Michelle. I just have this horrible feeling that underneath the
    window-dressing of xenophobia there is this inherent hatred amongst South Africans
    which is of grave concern to me. If we can do anything to help fight this then
    we should do everything in our power.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world the efforts of
    Social Media (and even in Afrigator's case) should have an impact on exposing
    the truth and to some degree it does. I'd like to see it do more though..."

Last night we published a brand new <a href="http://afrigator.com/topics/xenophobia">Xenophobia topic page</a> on <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> which highlights everything that is being covered throughout Africa about the recent xenophobic attacks in our country.
<a href="http://stii.za.net">Stii</a> and <a href="http://www.markforrester.co.za">Mark</a> worked like mad on this yesterday and I'm super impressed with the way in which the page has turned out. I urge you to <a href="http://blog.afrigator.com/2008/05/22/xenophobia-in-south-africa-how-were-helping/">read the blog post on the Afrigator blog</a> as it breaks down this page into much greater detail.
One thing I found particularly interesting to see is how many blog posts have been written about the xenophobic attacks. As of last night a total of 217 blog posts have been published compared to only 33 news articles on the same topic.
I really believe that this just highlights how everyone in South Africa is condemning these attacks and the fact that so many blog posts have been written is just awesome for awareness.
At this stage though I'm not sure what value 217 blog posts have on actually making a difference but the more we expose this issue the more I would hope it applies pressure on the powers that be to resolve this issue once and for all.
Help spread the word guys... let's stop this senseless killing.
