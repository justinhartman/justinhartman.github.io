At 17:15 on 15 April 2008 <a href="/2008/04/16/the-newest-addition-to-our-family/">Ben Hartman was born</a>.  It's impossible to quantify how much Ben has changed our lives over the last 12 months and it always amazes me how quickly time flies.
Ben is our second born son and I really love to see how different each of our children are. Luke is cautious and shy by nature while Ben is a maniac who shows no fear. He's already given me tons of <em>new</em> grey hair and I'm positive there's going to be a lot more in the years to come.
While Ben can't really understand the significance of today, Luke is completely excited that his little brother is one year old. Yesterday he said he was going to invite everyone we knew to Ben's birthday party but as we're recent Capetonian immigrants we don't really have anyone to invite :)
We don't want to damper Luke's excitement so we're off to buy Ben a really cool present this afternoon and then we're hitting the spur for a birthday dinner.
