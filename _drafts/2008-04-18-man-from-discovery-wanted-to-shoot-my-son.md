Yesterday morning we were minding our own business at the hospital when the Ward Nurse, Felicity, came to our room to have a discussion with us.
<strong>Felicity:</strong> Morning Mr. and Mrs. Hartman, I have a man here from Discovery Health and he wants to shoot your son. He is specifically looking for a white boy to shoot.
<strong>Me:</strong> He wants to shoot my son? Are you being serious?
<strong>Felicity:</strong> *laughs*, no sir, he is here to do a TV advert for Discovery Health and wants to know if you'll be willing to let them use your son for the advert. They will pay you of course.
Hmm... I started to see a couple dollar signs.
<strong>Colette:</strong> Could we get free medical aid?
<strong>Felicity:</strong> *laughs* - I don't know.
<strong>Me:</strong> Ok bring him in. We can't guarantee anything but we're willing to chat.
In steps Maurice, seemingly not from Discovery but rather the film crew involved in the Discovery advert.
<strong>Maurice:</strong> Hi folks, congratulations on the birth of your new child. We're shooting an ad for Discovery and we need a white, newborn baby to complete the scene.
<strong>Me:</strong> What exactly would my son have to do?
<strong>Maurice:</strong> Well the scene would involve having your son put into an incubator and then the tough-looking father comes in and touches his hand.
<strong>Me:</strong> ok...
<strong>Maurice:</strong> If you agree to let us use your son for the advert I'd have to drive to Pretoria so I can get him a work-permit.
A work-permit? What for? Oh wait, he's under 16... never mind that he's less than 2 days old.
<strong>Colette:</strong> When is the advert being shot?
<strong>Maurice:</strong> Tuesday morning.
<strong>Colette:</strong> That's going to be a problem because Tuesday morning is when our son's Bris is taking place.
<strong>Maurice:</strong> Oh...
<strong>Maurice:</strong> Can't you change the date?
My wife chuckles because a Bris has to be done 8-days after the baby is born.
<strong>Colette:</strong> No.
<strong>Me:</strong> Sorry Maurice, but we're just not going to be able to do this. Thanks for your time and sorry!
*Maurice scampers off disappointed*
