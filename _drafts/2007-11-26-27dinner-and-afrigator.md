Tomorrow night I'm doing a presentation at the <a href="http://27dinner.pbwiki.com">27dinner</a> at Melrose Arch in Johannesburg. We'll be making an announcement for <a href="http://afrigator.com">Afrigator</a> which I think is pretty cool so if you weren't planning on coming to the dinner before pop on over to hear what it's all about.
The cool thing for me is that this is going to be the first time that all four Afrigator guys are going to be in the same room and it's taken nearly eight months to get this right. Very exciting.
Hoping to see you all there!
