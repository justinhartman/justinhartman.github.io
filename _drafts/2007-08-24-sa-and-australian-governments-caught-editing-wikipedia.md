  content: "How reliable are you Justin? The South African Government editing Wikipedia?
    You make it sound like official policy - it was probably some little nerd in the
    stats office - hardly a \"plot\".\r\n\r\nI wonder why the local media so reactive
    when it comes to the government - I think if you took a poll of cabinet and parliament
    - who make up the SA Government  -there might be a only vague awareness  of what
    a Wiki is.\r\n\r\nI don't know about Australia, but guess it's much of the same
    and as for Wikipedia - I'm prepared to give it a go, although I cross check. \r\n\r\nEverything
    is propaganda Justin - Growing up in apartheid South Africa, the history I learned
    in printed schoolbooks, the religion I learned in church, it was all lies, all
    propaganda - at least with Wikipedia everyone has a chance to add their propaganda(or
    delete it), it isn't one sided - so that is pretty close to a democratic voice."

  content: "Hi Karen\r\n\r\nYou are most likely correct that there is only a handful
    of people (possibly) involved in this censorship but does that change anything?
    The point I'm trying to make is that Gov both here and in Australia are trying
    to censor content - end of story.\r\n\r\nNow we can debate till the cows come
    home just how widespread the issue is in Government but for me that's not relevant.
    If one of them does it how long do you think it will take for the rest of them
    to latch on?\r\n\r\nWas I a little overzealous with the propaganda issue - definitely!
    \r\n\r\nThat said, I've watched the issues crop up over Wikipedia pages that are
    factually incorrect, some of which refused to be changed by Wikipedia themselves
    and while this aims to be a democratic voice for the masses and the information
    contained most people won't ever know about the incorrect ones. \r\n\r\nAre we
    not just starting a new culture of disinformation?"

    is often my fist stop. Then I check the facts with other sources.(I'm neurotic,
    so I check with a few sources anyway). I think it could become a very interesting
    resource, especially for Africa when more people are able to make their voices
    heard and tell the history we still don't know about.\r\n\r\nEveryone believes
    their beliefs are right - did you watch Christiane Amanpour's brilliant three
    part CNN series God's Warriors that ended last night?\r\n\r\nBut hopefully with
    a website where everyone can add and delete, it will eventually balance out."

IT Web yesterday <a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/sections/internet/2007/0708231100.asp?A=ITG&S=IT%20in%20Government&O=FPLEAD">broke a story</a> that the South African government was attempting to censor the largest human edited encyclopedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>. In their article they report that
<blockquote>Wikipedia's edit history for the article &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa">HIV/Aids in South Africa</a>&acirc;&euro; shows repeated vandalism from IP address 164.151.130.36. This address resolves to a machine called mx1.statssa.gov.za, located just off the Ben Schoeman highway in Centurion, and is owned and operated by the South African government.
</blockquote>
As if this isn't bad enough I just finished <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/23/wikipedia-edits-cause-australian-political-scandal/">reading an article</a> on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> about the Australian Prime Minister&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Office having been caught editing Wikipedia as well. TechCrunch have reported that
<blockquote>Staff from the Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PMC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Costello&diff=prev&oldid=141096645">edited Wikipedia entries</a> that were damaging to the Goverment, including pages covering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_overboard">Children Overboard Affair</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_detention_in_Australia">Mandatory Detention</a>. Other edits included deleting the nickname of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Captain Smirk&acirc;&euro; from the Wikipedia biography of Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, and a range of bizarre edits, including the addition of the line &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Poo bum dicky wee wee&acirc;&euro; to a Wikipedia article on Bubishi, a book related to Martial Arts.
</blockquote>
These recent plots by Governments have been uncovered by the <a href="http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/">Wikiscanner</a> which lists anonymous Wikipedia edits from large corporations. The question this raises (and has done so for some time in my mind) is just how reliable Wikipedia really is. I've always implored the effort of Wikipedia but as with anything opened to public consumption you leave yourself open to cheating and blatant propaganda that can't really be combated.
