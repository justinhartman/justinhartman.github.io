<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2010/02/Screen-shot-2010-02-21-at-8.53.35-PM.png" alt="" title="A to Z of SA" width="358" height="111" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-922" />In December last year I was invited by Apple to attend the launch of a new campaign called the <a href="http://www.az-za.co.za/">A to Z of SA</a>. In short, the campaign is about promoting South Africa in a positive light, rather than the negative one we see every day in the media. Apple have decided that, with 2010 being just around the corner, it's time South African's showcased the best of SA to the world in an effort to help change perceptions.
The launch in Cape Town was an experience to remember. The theme was the <em>Ama-zing Race</em> and we were told to find clues along the way and follow them. We were all given Nikon cameras along with our first clue and the key to a fancy Mini Cooper. The clue was simply to find which Mini was ours and I'm pleased to report we got the convertible.
Our next clue, inside the car, told us to explore the sights of Cape Town and take as many photos as possible along the way. Along with our cool, bright-red cabrio we each had a <em>padkos</em> bag filled with SA-only goodies and an iPod jacked into the Mini which, yip you guessed it, only had South African artists on it.
Adele and I drove for well over three hours in the basking sun, snapping away like German tourists all the while taking in the pleasures of Cape Town.
When we returned to the iStore we were tasked with creating a photo book from our pics using only iPhoto and the built in software. I must admit, after zipping around all day in a Mini, this wasn't the easiest thing to do but the software did simplify our lives. Sadly our photo book didn't with the super cool iPod but about three days later we received a hardcopy of the book which can be seen below.

The good news is that anyone can enter this cool campaign and win prizes along the way. Read the <a href="http://www.az-za.co.za/">A to Z of SA</a> website for more details on how you go about doing this.
This was an awesome day where I got to explore the beauty of Cape Town and I think this new campaign by Apple is one of positivity and hope which we should all get behind. If any of you would like to attend one of the upcoming <em>Ama-zing Race</em> (Jo'burg and Cape Town) where you too can experience a day similar to this - please let me know. You can post a comment below or email me directly justin@hartman.me and I can get you onboard.
