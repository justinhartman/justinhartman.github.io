Technology and globalisation go hand-in-hand. Globalisation unleashes technology, which in turn drives companies to plan production and sales on a global basis. Technology changes the work we do and the jobs created by it demand more education and training. It also changes the way business operates by transforming relationships between suppliers, producers, retailers and customers.
One aspect of globalisation that tends to be most apparent in almost every facet of life is the emergence of technology - particularly the way in which technology is globally integrating people of the world. The advent of the Internet has over the past decade provided a common platform upon which countries from all corners of the Earth are able to communicate and share information.
<strong>Global Emergence of the Information Age</strong>
In the space of thirty years technology has caused widespread improvements in access to information and economic potential.
If you consider that just twenty five years ago the use of personal computers was still limited to a fairly small number of technologically advanced people while the majority of people produced documents with typewriters.
Twenty years ago, large and hefty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mobile_phones">mobile phones</a> were carried only by a small number of users and some fifteen years ago only limited universities and scientists were using, or had even heard about, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>.
Today however computers, mobile technology and the Internet have transformed communication and commerce, creating entirely new ways for retailers and their customers to transact and for businesses to manage the flow of production and market their products.
Websites, chat rooms, instant messaging systems, email, forums and other Internet-based communication systems have made it much easier for people with common interests to find each other, exchange information, and collaborate which was almost unheard of until the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_age">Information Age</a>.
<strong>Technology Transformation in South Africa</strong>
With over 30 million subscribers the mobile industry in South Africa is booming. While this industry is largely controlled by the major mobile phone operators, making entry into the market difficult, almost every South African has access to mobile technology.
Internet adoption in South Africa has been slow off the starting blocks. There are some 5 million people accessing the Internet everyday and currently we have more than 1 million broadband subscribers yet these figures represent only a small portion of the population.
One of the primary reasons for the poor rate of adoption of broadband and the Internet, in comparison to the mobile industry, is the high-costs associated with going online. Added to this, South Africa has not had the technology or infrastructure to facilitate fast adoption rates and the early adopters have had to uncover defects and fund development of the technology further.
Fortunately, over the last couple years, companies and local government have been investing heavily in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_optics">Fibre optics</a> and the infrastructure needed which will not only help drive costs down but also increase accessibility and adoption through the use of these improved technologies.
<strong>Leveraging Technology</strong>
Technology facilitates the expansion of products, ideas, and resources among countries as well as people regardless of geographic location. Technology can be leveraged to create efficient and effective channels to exchange information and can be the catalyst for global integration.
The single greatest benefit of technology is its ability to multiply effort. This multiplier of technology turns the effort of one person into many.
Any business can leverage technology to work:
<ul>
<li>Faster</li>
<li>Productively</li>
<li>Predictably</li>
<li>Safer</li>
<li>Efficiently</li>
</ul>
With the advances in technology any business can now do more with less.
<strong>Challenges and Successes</strong>
As an emerging market South Africa has some fundamental issues affecting global emergence. Some of these include high-costs, low Internet penetration, unemployment and lack of education, yet despite this advances in technology are producing many positive changes in our society. 
Technology innovations have created new jobs, promoted the growth of new markets, and increased international trade and investment but one of the biggest technology challenges we need to address, which makes us unique to first-world countries, is the major divide between mobile and Internet users.
What is evidenced today is that only a small minority access the Internet while the majority of the population use their mobile phones for various tasks yet there is little to bridge the two users together.
The greatest opportunity that exists in our global emergence is the ability to understand how to use all this technology to our advantage, bridge the gap between mobile and Internet users, and in turn solve the various communication and technology problems that we are faced with as a developing country.
