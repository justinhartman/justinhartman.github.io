Ok so I'm getting really frustrated with CSS and Internet Explorer. Why Micro$oft can't create a better standards-based browser I will never know. They've done much better with IE7 but still it's a freeking mess if you ask me.
I've been working on this <strong>really</strong> cool project and I've developed (like most) using Firefox as my browser of choice. Being a Linux man I don't even have IE on my machines so you can imagine my frustration when I see my hard work look like crap in IE6 & 7.
I am desperate for someone to help me get my CSS file right for IE6 & 7. The site looks and works great in Firefox 1.5, Firefox 2.0, Safari and Opera but it's just that elusive IE that is messing with my head. 
I would need for that <em>special someone</em> to optimise my CSS file (removing all the junk) and obviously fix up whatever mess there is with IE so that the site looks like it should. It's rather an urgent thing this so if you've got the skills pop me a mail justin@hartman.me and I'll give you more info and you can give me a price.
