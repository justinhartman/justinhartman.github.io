    was very surprised to find that someone had actually done a survey on this. I
    was wondering if there are any differences between men and women and the direction
    in which they stir? Is there any correlation between the sexes and whether they
    are left or right handed. And just to be awkward; what about ambidextrous people

    only surveyed 3 left-handed people. I'm left-handed and don't see how it's possible
    to stir counter-clockwise (which, according to your graph, is what most left-handers
    do).

  content: I agree with the initial graphs which tend to show that right handed people
    stirr clockwise...its only perverse right handed persons like my son, who is counter
    clockwise just to irritate me! But I know I'm right, of course he also knows that
    he is right, as teenagers know everything.

Brace yourself for one of the most random blog posts you'll ever read from me!
I drink a fair amount of coffee each day and I always stir my coffee in a clockwise motion while making it. This got me thinking about whether or not stirring coffee in a clockwise motion is the norm for right-handed people.
It has been bugging me for about three days now so today I asked <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a>, <a href="http://www.ian-judiet.za.net/">Ian</a> and <a href="http://www.noboxmedia.com">Robin</a> which direction they stir their coffee. The results were interesting. 
Gregor is the only left-hander in our team and he stirs his coffee in a clockwise motion while Ian is right-handed and stirs counter clockwise. Like Ian, Robin is also right-handed and stirs counter clockwise.
This bugged me even more because as a right-hander myself I felt that I was now abnormal stirring my coffee clockwise. Did this mean that left-handers naturally stir clockwise while right-handers stir counter clockwise? I had to investigate further.
Within half an hour the four of us made some phone calls, <a href="http://twitter.com/justinhartman/statuses/838692666">posted to twitter</a> and did a spot poll with anyone we could find in the office. All in all we ended up with a total of 35 people who responded to the question:- <em>Which way do you stir your tea/coffee?</em>
Of our 35 unsuspecting lab rats we had a total of 3 left-handers and 32 right-handers and you can see the results of each group below.
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/06/left-right.jpg" alt="Results of Left and Right handed stirrers" />
<img src="/assets/images/uploads/2008/06/total.jpg" alt="The Total Results" title="The Total Results" align="right" />As you can see from the totals graph it is clear that stirring your coffee in a clockwise motion is the preferred and most natural way for most people.
I started this escapade to get a conclusive answer but now I have to admit I'm no clearer than I was before the experiment. Whether you're left or right handed it seems that results will vary greatly and an individual's stirring habits are simply down to personal preference.
