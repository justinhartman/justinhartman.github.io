    Debian on your mac. I didn't hear of the plans to drop Ubuntu ppc support - ubuntu
    ist what I'm running on my ibook G4.\r\nCould you please let me know how easy
    it is to get on with Debian in comparison to Ubuntu? I had Debian on my previous
    machine, but just for 2 months or so because I was quite a newbie and didn't get
    on with it... How easy is the installation of etch and yaboot? Is it \"all inclusive\"
    as in ubuntu?\r\nSincerely, silke (from Germany)"

    have tried all as a personal OS but never lasted because I found them too unstable
    and unreliable for everyday use. I decided to give Ubuntu a bash (as has been
    documented) because I was a little scared of Debian myself but what I did find
    was that Ubuntu didn't handle PowerPC very well and was very buggy. I often ran
    out of resources, system crashes etc.\r\n\r\nThat said Ubuntu was still more stable
    as a personal OS than the others I tried. When I learned that Ubuntu were dropping
    PPC I decided to give Debian a try. I started with the \"testing\" version A.K.A.
    Etch and within a week I was using the \"unstable\" version A.K.A. Sid.\r\n\r\nI
    found that the unstable version of Debian was far more stable than Ubuntu ever
    was for me and this is testament to the Debian team. Debian runs a much newer
    kernel version than Ubuntu and I think as a result you shouldn't have a problem
    installing on a Mac.\r\n\r\nIf I knew then what I knew now I would have gone with
    Debian from the start, Don't get me wrong Ubuntu is GREAT but for PowerPC and
    Mac I would go with Debian any day of the week.\r\n\r\nIf you're still not 100%
    sure download a Debian Live CD (http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) and boot
    up on your mac to see how it goes. If you can run the live CD you know that Debian
    and Yaboot will install without problems."

    out the important things quite fast.\r\nEnjoy Etch and thanks!\r\nsilke"

After grappling long and hard about the whole <a href="/2006/12/05/power-pc-canned-by-ubuntu/">Ubuntu dropping PowerPC support</a> issue I have made a decision to move my Apple iBook G4 from my <a href="/2006/11/20/ibook-g4-now-sporting-ubuntu-edgy-eft/">recently installed</a> Ubuntu 6.10 to the ever popular <a href="http://www.debian.com">Debian</a> platform.

<a href="/2006/12/07/mark-shuttleworth-puts-me-in-my-place/">Mark Shuttleworth's email</a> to me and the whole debate that has gone on about Ubuntu's decision to drop PowerPC has made this decision difficult. 

However, seeing as I have only recently moved from Apple OSX to Ubuntu I figured it's better to move now and stick with a distro that will support PowerPC for probably a few more years than be stuck with a distro that is left to the devices of a community that might simply let PowerPC support die a slow and bitter death.

The overall consensus I got from the <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">Ubuntu Forums</a> is that PowerPC users are already looking for a new Linux distro which has also played a big part in deciding to move to Debian. That said I will still support Ubuntu and keep my current 6.10 installations on my PC at home and work while my iBook will now begin the big migrate to Debian.

I have also recently offered my services to the <a href="http://www.ubuntu-za.org/">Ubuntu Za LoCo Team</a> and I will be doing work with other South African Ubuntu users to help promote and get the Ubuntu name out in the local community.

So, here's to a new installation and hopefully the last for quite a while!
