  content: There is also an official Debian wiki ( http://wiki.debian.org/ ) which
    you might find useful. I understand that https://justin.hartman.me/linux/ is for
    your personal use. As a fellow Debian user, it would be nice if you can contribute
    some of your findings there as well!

I'm please to announce that I've officially launched my own <a href="https://justin.hartman.me/linux/">Debian Wiki</a>. Over the last two weeks I have been setting up a new server for <a href="http://www.grabble.co.za">Grabble</a> and due to my growing attraction to Debian I decided this new server will be powered entirely off of the ever popular <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU/Linux</a> distribution.
The Debian Wiki was created solely because I needed something to help me keep track of what I was doing when setting the server up and as such it has developed into a whole series of tutorials if you will. There is a lot of documentation out there for Debian however it is difficult to make that documentation work for the new (soon-to-be) stable release of Debian 4 a.k.a. Etch and the Debian Wiki aims to fix this problem.
Every single HOWTO on the Debian Wiki has had to be tailored to work with Etch and as such I hope that others can find value when needing to setup a similar item on their Debian based server. The <a href="https://justin.hartman.me/linux/Category:Debian_Server">Server Category</a> items on the Wiki are confusing to the layman however as time goes on I want to have a whole bunch of Desktop related items so that people who've never used Linux before can actually see that it's not that difficult to operate!
So head on over to <a href="https://justin.hartman.me/linux/">https://justin.hartman.me/linux/</a> and give me your thoughts!
