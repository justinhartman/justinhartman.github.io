This is really basic stuff but if you aren't running a GUI then it isn't as easy as opening up a Time & Date Settings control panel so this is the way to do it.

## Setting the timezone
You first want to check what the current date and time is on your machine. Do this by running the following in a Linux shell:
```bash
$ date
```
This should return something like this:
```bash
Tue Mar  6 20:47:59 SAST 2007
```
You can also check the timezone you're currently using by running:
```bash
$ cat /etc/timezone
```
Which would return something like this:
```bash
Africa/Johannesburg
```
Now if none of this is correct you want to setup your timezone by running this command:
```bash
$ tzconfig
```
On Debian Lenny (5.0) you need to run this command:
```bash
$ dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```
Select your continent and type in your city and hit enter. This should return the following:
```bash
Your default time zone is set to 'Africa/Johannesburg'.
Local time is now:      Tue Mar  6 20:50:15 SAST 2007.
Universal Time is now:  Tue Mar  6 18:50:15 UTC 2007.
```
## Synchronise your clock with a NTP server
NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate over the Internet. `ntpdate` is a simple NTP client which allows a system's clock to be set to match the time obtained by communicating with one or more servers.

Install the ntp client
```bash
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install ntpdate
```
`ntpdate` will automatically run when booting your system.
