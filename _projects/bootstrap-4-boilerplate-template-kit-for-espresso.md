# Bootstrap 4 Boilerplate Template Kit for Espresso

A Boilerplate Template Kit for [Espresso][espressoapp] that speeds up your
project development by providing templates, code, CSS, fonts and scripts using
the [Bootstrap][bootstrap] framework.

## What is Included

The Boilerplate Kit's primary objective is to accelerate your development
process by providing you with all the files and code needed for working with the
most current release of Bootstrap - currently version 4.1.3. Not
only does this Kit include all the Bootstrap CSS and JS, `jQuery`, `Popper.js`
and `Holder.js` scripts, but it also includes **20 fully-functional example
templates** that you can fire up and begin using as a base for your project.

Here is what is included in this Boilerplate Kit for `Espresso`.

### Bootstrap 4.1.3

You get the latest, minified CSS and JavaScript files for Bootstrap 4.1.3.
These are:

- bootstrap.min.css
- bootstrap.min.css.map
- bootstrap.min.js

### Vendor Scripts

The following vendor scripts are included in the template.

1. [Bootstrap 4.1.3][bootstrap]
1. [jQuery Slim 3.3.1][jquery]
1. [Popper 3.6.0][popper]
1. [Holder.js 2.9.4+cabil][holder]

### Theme Templates

The Bootstrap 4 Boilerplate Kit template for Espresso includes the following 20
template variations ranging from using parts of the framework to custom
components and layouts as well as Bootstrap experiments.

Here is an overview (with screenshots) of each of the included templates in the
Boilerplate Kit.

### Theme Options

The following screenshot outlines the various options available to you when you
create a _New Project_ within `Espresso`.

![Theme Options][options]

### Extras

There is an optional Extras section which allows you to include extra
configuration files that form part of most modern-day web projects.

In the `Theme Options` you will find the following settings for you to choose
from:

![Theme Options][extras]

These extras are:

1. **IE Classes:** this includes markup in your HTML document for IE9 that will
   display a browser upgrade message. When selecting this option a new
   `browser-upgrade.css` file is included in your `/css/` folder and is linked
   in your HTML markup. If you don't select this option then no additional
   markup or CSS is added to your HTML template.
1. **Server Extras:** includes an `.htaccess`, `robots.txt` and `humans.txt`
   file in the root of your project folder. You can edit these files and
   customise them to your needs. This option is selected by default as these
   files are recommended but if you don't select them then none of these files
   are added to your project.
1. **Google Analytics:** by including this, additional Google Analytics code is
   included in your markup just before the closing `</body>` tag. You have the
   option of inputting your Site ID at time of creating your template or, if you
   only create the GA tag later on, you can add the Site ID to the markup later
   on. If this option is unticked, no additional code is added to your markup.
1. **Font Awesome:** includes the CSS and webfonts required for using the
   [Font Awesome][fontawesome] library in your projects. To use Font Awesome
   just add markup to your html like this `<i class="fa fa-star"></i>` and you
   will get a star icon loaded in your document. If you don't select this option
   then the CSS and `/webfonts/` directory are not copied over into your
   project.

### Favicons

Each Bootstrap template that is generated from the Boilerplate Kit contains a
range of favicons that you can customise and use in your projects.

In the HTML markup for each template you will see these meta-tags:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json"> <!-- For Android Devices. -->
<meta name="msapplication-config" content="browserconfig.xml"> <!-- For Windows and Microsoft Mobile. -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png"> <!-- For Apple iOS. -->
<link rel="mask-icon" href="img/favicons/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#563d7c"> <!-- For Safari. -->
```

The following breaks down what each of the meta-tags provide.

- `favicon.ico` is the first meta-tag and sits in the root of your project
  folder. The `favicon.ico` is a compiled icon image made of 16x16, 32x32 and,
  in some cases, 48x48 pixel images. If you don't know how to generate a
  `favicon.ico` have a [look at this resource][favicon].
- `manifest.json` is used by Android devices and sits in your root folder. This
  json file contains the path to the various Android-specific favicon files.
  These files are located in `/img/favicons/` and are labelled
  `android-chrome-192x192.png` and `android-chrome-512x512.png`. These are the
  default sizes required for most Android devices.
- `browserconfig.xml` is similar to the Android `manifest.json` but this file is
  specific to Windows and Microsoft devices. The `browserconfig.xml` contains
  links to Microsoft-specific favicon files. These files are located in
  `/img/favicons/` and are prefixed with `mstile-*` and then the file
  dimensions. Each of these files cover an array of Windows and Mobile device
  sizes.
- `apple-touch-icon` is a link to the favicon used for iOS devices. There is
  only one size image for iOS devices as this is all you really need to provide
  but some developers choose to add more icons to cater for specific iOS
  devices. You don't need to add more but feel free to should you want.
- `safari-pinned-tab.svg` is a link to a SVG file which is used by Safari on
  macOS and iOS. This is a transparent, single-colour SVG which is styled by the
  `color="#563d7c"` class in the meta-tag. This favicon is used when people add
  your website to their favourites and appears under the favourite sites in
  Safari.

**NB: PLEASE TAKE NOTE**{: .btn .btn--success .btn--small}  
The files contained in **/img/favicons/** are all Bootstrap
favicons and you will need to redesign each of the images and SVG files in this
directory (or delete what you aren't going to use in your markup). You will also
need to update the **TileColor** contained in the **browserconfig.xml** file as
well as the **theme_color** and **background_color** in the **manifest.json** to
your website's primary colour used. The current colours are all Bootstrap
specific colours and need changing.
