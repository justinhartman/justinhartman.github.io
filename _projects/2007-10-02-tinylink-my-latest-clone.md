<a href="http://tinylink.co.za/"><img src='/assets/images/uploads/2007/10/tinylink.png' alt='TinyLink' /></a>

I've been a big fan of <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL!</a> for some time now and I've been quite fascinated with how the whole thing is put together so after having a chat with <a href="http://blog.colindaniels.co.za/">Colin</a> and <a href="http://groogle.co.za">Gregor</a> on Friday about the whole architecture of TinyURL I decided to have a go and see what I could come up with. I'm pleased to say that it didn't take altogether that long and by Sunday evening <a href="http://tinylink.co.za">TinyLink</a> went live.

The biggest challenge for me was structuring the database so that a shortened URL would never exceeding six characters and this took some figuring out but I've now got a structure that can handle, literally, a couple billion short URLs.

I also created some help files for IE7, Firefox and Safari which shows you how to add a TinyLink button to your browser so that you can easily convert a long URL into a short one with one simple click.

There is absolutely no commercial value in this, the logo is crap and I only did it to see if I could replicate this great service so please go easy on me...
