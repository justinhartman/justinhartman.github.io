The alias command makes composer available globally. It is useful to move it as you may want or need to install other packages via Composer.You will now be able to run composer at the following location:$ /Applications/XAMPP/bin/composer/composer.pharor simply run:$ composerSetting up a CakePHP projectBy default Composer will install the most current version of CakePHP that works with the PHP version in XAMPP. I did not want to run PHP 7 so I chose to download XAMPP using PHP version 5.6.30. Running PHP 5 or 7 really won’t matter to installing CakePHP; either version will work.Working DirectoryXAMPP serves website files from the htdocs folder so you will need to ensure that you are in the correct path before installing CakePHP.In the terminal window run the following command to navigate to the htdocs folder.$ cd /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocsInstall CakePHPFinally we are now ready to install CakePHP. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal window.$ /Applications/XAMPP/bin/php composer create-project –prefer-dist helloworld/app helloworldVery Important: In the above command you need to replace helloworld with the name of the project you are setting up.Once the command has run you will now have a new folder in the htdocs folder. You can now fire-up the site in your browser.Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.* Save the file as `/_layouts/humans.html`What you have done is create a completely new template that will only output the content and ignore any template files you may have. By default, Jekyll will wrap your text in a paragraph (`&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;`) tag so the `strip_html` part in the above tells Jekyll to simply dump the raw text without any HTML tags. ## Create Humans Markdown fileGo ahead and create a file in the root of your Jekyll site and save it as `humans.md`. You have to create the Markdown file so that Jekyll can compile the page when it generates the site. If you create a `txt` file you lose the ability to access Jekyll's Liquid variables and we need this.To comply to [the humans standard][standard] you will need to have at least these two sections in your `humans.md` file: 1. `/* TEAM */` 2. `/* SITE */`I have more in [my file][my-humans] but add what you feel is necessary for yours. In this example let's assume your `humans.md` file now looks like this:/* TEAM */    Boss: Your name    Email: be weary of spam    Twitter: @username    From: The country you live in/* SITE */    Last update: ???????????    Language: English    Doctype: HTML5    IDE: Sublime Text 3, Github Pages, JekyllThe `Last update` field is where we use Jekyll's Liquid variable `2018-03-03 07:27:16 +0200`. Copy and paste `2018-03-03 07:27:16 +0200` next to the `Last update:` field so that your Markdown includes the tag and ends up looking like this:/* SITE */    Last update: 2018-03-03 07:27:16 +0200    Language: English    Doctype: HTML5    IDE: Sublime Text 3, Github Pages, Jekyll## Linking your template and define a permalinkYou now need to ensure that `humans.md` is accessing your `humans.html` template file you created. Go ahead and open up your `/humans.md` file. Add the following code snippet to the top of your file:layout: humanspermalink: ‘/humans.txt’—Your file should end up looking like this:layout: humanspermalink: ‘/humans.txt’—/* TEAM */    Boss: Your name    Email: be weary of spam    Twitter: @username    From: The country you live in/* SITE */    Last update: 2018-03-03 07:27:16 +0200    Language: English    Doctype: HTML5    IDE: Sublime Text 3, Github Pages, JekyllSetting the `permalink` to `/humans.txt` is important because we want to conform to standards and we want to render a plain txt page for search engines and the like.## Adding the meta-tag to your templateThe final step is to add a valid meta-tag to your `&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;` section in your main template file. In my case my main template is `/_includes/default.html`Add the following line to your template:```html&amp;lt;link rel='author' href='humans.txt' type='text/plain'&amp;gt;If you aren’t sure where to put this meta-tag look for the structure similar to the below example which is in your template.&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;&quot; /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;meta content='text/html; charset=utf-8' http-equiv='Content-Type'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;Give it a whirlOnce you have published your changes you should be able to access your newly created humans file at yourdomain.com/humans.txt.SupportIf you need any help, found a bug or to report any issues please click here and log a support request.","aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"5","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"5","ratingCount":"1"}}

<p>Install the latest version of Composer.
  Move the composer phar file to the XAMPP bin directory.

<p>Setting up a CakePHP project</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  Working Directory

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Minimum Requirements
I have successfully tested the installation using the following package versions:</p>

<p>Mac OS X 10.7.5
  XAMPP 5.6.30-0
  Composer 1.4.1</p>

<p>Earlier versions of the above software may indeed work however I have not tested them so YMMV.</p>

<p>Getting Composer
Open up a terminal window and run the following shell commands. This will download the composer setup file, verify the installer is valid and create the packaged composer.phar file.</p>

<p>Download and Build
$ /Applications/XAMPP/bin/php -r “copy(‘https://getcomposer.org/installer’, ‘composer-setup.php’);”
$ /Applications/XAMPP/bin/php -r “if (hash_file(‘SHA384’, ‘composer-setup.php’) === ‘669656bab3166a7aff8a7506b8cb2d1c292f042046c5a994c43155c0be6190fa0355160742ab2e1c88d40d5be660b410’) { echo ‘Installer verified’; } else { echo ‘Installer corrupt’; unlink(‘composer-setup.php’); } echo PHP_EOL;”
$ /Applications/XAMPP/bin/php composer-setup.php
$ /Applications/XAMPP/bin/php -r “unlink(‘composer-setup.php’);”</p>

<p>Moving things around
Once you see the Installer Verified message output in your terminal window you can then run the following command.
$ mv composer.phar /Applications/XAMPP/bin/composer
$ alias composer=’/Applications/XAMPP/bin/composer/composer.phar’</p>

<p>This command moves the composer.phar file to the XAMPP bin directory so that you can access it from a centralised location within XAMPP. The alias command makes composer available globally. It is useful to move it as you may want or need to install other packages via Composer.</p>

<p>You will now be able to run composer at the following location:
$ /Applications/XAMPP/bin/composer/composer.phar</p>

<p>or simply run:
$ composer</p>

<p>Setting up a CakePHP project
By default Composer will install the most current version of CakePHP that works with the PHP version in XAMPP. I did not want to run PHP 7 so I chose to download XAMPP using PHP version 5.6.30. Running PHP 5 or 7 really won’t matter to installing CakePHP; either version will work.</p>

<p>Working Directory
XAMPP serves website files from the htdocs folder so you will need to ensure that you are in the correct path before installing CakePHP.</p>

<p>In the terminal window run the following command to navigate to the htdocs folder.
$ cd /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs</p>

<p>Install CakePHP
Finally we are now ready to install CakePHP. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal window.
$ /Applications/XAMPP/bin/php composer create-project –prefer-dist helloworld/app helloworld</p>

<p>Very Important: In the above command you need to replace helloworld with the name of the project you are setting up.</p>

<p>Once the command has run you will now have a new folder in the htdocs folder. You can now fire-up the site in your browser.</p>

 2. `/* SITE */`

I have more in [my file][my-humans] but add what you feel is necessary for yours. In this example let's assume your `humans.md` file now looks like this:

## Adding the meta-tag to your template
The final step is to add a valid meta-tag to your `&lt;head&gt;` section in your main template file. In my case my main template is `/_includes/default.html`

Add the following line to your template:
```html
&lt;link rel='author' href='humans.txt' type='text/plain'&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you aren’t sure where to put this meta-tag look for the structure similar to the below example which is in your template.</p>

    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
