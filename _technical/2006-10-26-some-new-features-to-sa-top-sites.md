Two major enhancements have been added to the SA Top Sites system which I am very excited about. The first is a Google PageRank display and the second is a New Members page on SA Top Sites.

If you go to the SA Top Sites home page you will now notice that the first 10 listings contain a small Google PageRank image that relates to that specific site. This PageRank image also displays for the top 10 listings in each section as well as on the 10 New Members page.

The second new function is a new members page. On this page we list the 10 latest members to SA Top Sites and in doing so I hope that we can provide additional value to new members of SA Top Sites.
