  content: "I have an Xbox, not a 360, the older gen.  But personally I preferred
    it tons more than ps2. Xbox 360 is offering what PS3 and is miles cheaper. Games
    are also reasonable.\r\n\r\nI think that for me the choice was made by Sony which
    platform to purchase, and it's not theirs!"

  content: "The PS3 has priced itself out of the picture in South Africa with it's
    R6300 price tag.\r\n\r\nNo matter how great the machine was it would not be worth
    that for gaming. The scary thing is that it's actually not any better than the
    360 and in all graphical comparisons so far it has either tied or been worse than
    the 360. \r\n\r\nAdd to that the fact that it no longer has rumble or an active
    online system to compare with Live! and it becomes harder to justify the price....\r\n\r\nI
    wrote an article comparing the two if you are interested,\r\nhttp://www.lazygamer.co.za/xbox-360/xbox-360-vs-ps3/\r\n\r\nOh
    and games for the PS3 and Xbox 360 are pretty much the same price, it's only the
    original purchase which is so vastly different."

  content: I own both Xbox and Xbox 360. I also opted for the Nintendo Wii during
    the holidays here in the states instead of the Playstation for the pure reason
    that the Xbox offered the Graphics and gameplay I would like from a High End console,
    and the Wii is a lot of fun when friends and non-gamers come over. For the price
    of one Playstation III you can rather get a 360 and a Wii. I boils down to the
    games, and price, and Sony is losing on both grounds here.

Let me state before I start ranting that I <strike>am</strike> was a huge supporter of <a href="http://www.sony.co.za">Sony</a> in that I own a PS1, PlayStation 2 and PSP. All in all I've been a very happy customer of Sony for many years now up until I saw the price tag of the new PS3. 

At a <strong>whopping R6,300</strong> I wonder how many people can afford to actually purchase this hunk of dead-weight? Ok, maybe I'm being too hard on the PS3 but as far as I can see it offers very little to command such a high purchase price.

According to <a href="http://www.playstation.co.za/ps3/PS3_Mini/about_ps3/productdetails.asp">Sony's PlayStation website</a> the PS3 comes with a 60GB hard drive, superior quality 7.1 digital sound, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 4 x USB ports and integration with PSP. All sounds reasonable except you could purchase a PC with the same specs for about half the price and let's face it even entry level PCs look slicker than the new PS3 design.

I'm also curious to know what games are going to cost? Historically games have been the most expensive commodity in owning a PlayStation and with their new Blu-ray Disc technology I guess it's safe to assume that games will come in around the R1,000 mark!?

I have never owned an Xbox but it seems to me that Microsoft have catered for all income brackets in terms of the ability to buy a basic system for a few thousand Rand. Maybe Sony are doing the same but I see no reference to this anywhere and it looks like one size fits all apparently.

In my honest opinion gaming products should never surpass monthly car repayments and at this price <strong>herewith ends</strong> my long-standing relationship with Sony and dare I suggest a new one with Microsoft's Xbox.
