For those of you not using the Firefox browser here is an interesting article about its development. Co-developed by a 19-year old techie (Ross) it has far surpassed what Internet Explorer can do and I highly recommend you download it to see what it can do. 

I've been using the beta version and even in it's testing phases I never had a problem. The best benefit I find is that new browser windows can open up as tabs in a single window which in my opinion has always been IE's flaw. Why after so many years has Microsoft insisted on not adding this feature to their browser? 

Besides which, anything Microsoft is BAD so a little competition never hurt.
