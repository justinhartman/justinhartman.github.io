<a href="http://shop.grabble.co.za">Grabble Shopping</a> is the first of many new add-ons to the Grabble portfolio. This new sub-product of grabble is an initiative between Grabble and <a href="http://www.pricecheck.co.za">PriceCheck</a> and hopes to provide a useful comparison shopping website for all users of the Grabble search engine.

About three weeks ago I was approached by Kevin from <a href="http://www.pricecheck.co.za">PriceCheck</a> to potentially do some work together and I was certainly looking to provide some time of search for shopping websites in South Africa.

I particularly liked Kevin as the two of us share a common idea about websites should provide to the end user and it was ultimately his open mindedness that swayed me to go with him on this project.

Grabble Shopping is now a powerful tool to find products online, from South African merchants, at the best available price. We have more than 15,000 products in the database to search from and while this site is still in beta testing stages it is a rock-solid platform that works.

Give it a bash at <a href="http://shop.grabble.co.za">shop.grabble.co.za</a> and let me know what you think about it.
