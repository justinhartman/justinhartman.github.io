As if the $1.5 billion profit that Microsoft made last year wasn't enough they now plan to squash the Google engine with their new search engine. My guess is that at the end of the day users of search engines will need to evaluate what works for them. 

It's interesting to me that MSN's search engine is based largely around the Google look & feel so I am not sure where they plan to overtake the Google market share? 

Having said that MSN is number 3 behind Yahoo and Google in terms of the most used search engine so possibly Microsoft's new engine will prove to be a huge factor agains Google... Only time will tell.
