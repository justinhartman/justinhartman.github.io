Imagine my suprise when I realised yesterday that my Google PageRank jumped from a minute 4 out of 10 to 7 out of 10!!!!! I have been working very hard over the last few months to get this PageRank up and finally I can see the rewards.

For those of you that don't know what PageRank is let me explain. PageRank is the method that Google uses to determine the relevance and importance of a web site in their search engine database. Sites with a higher PageRank value will automatically appear higher in search engine results than sites with a lower PageRank so having a high PageRank is of the utmost importance.

My site now is on the same level as <a href="http://www.is.co.za">Internet Solutions </a>and <a href="http://www.ananzi.co.za">Ananzi </a>and it has a higher PageRank then sites like <a href="http://www.msn.co.za">MSN </a>and <a href="http://www.careerjunction.co.za">CareerJunction</a>. While I was expecting a jump I really did not expect it to jump this high and it almost feels too good to be true. I almost want to pinch myself to force myself to wake up... :)

This is great news for my business because up until recently the highest PageRank I have seen for local South African web sites is 6 out of 10. Google has updated their PageRank database (which happens every three months or so) and now there are quite a few sites that have moved up to the 7 mark. I can now only hope that this new higher PageRank equates to bigger business.
