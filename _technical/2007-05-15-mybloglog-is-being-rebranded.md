At the recent <a href="http://www.sobevent.com/about/">SOBcon</a> conference in Chicago <a href="http://sleepyblogger.com/">Robyn Tippins</a> spoke about several major upcoming changes with <a href="http://mybloglog.com">MyBlogLog</a>. <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> recently purchased MyBlogLog and Robyn was hired as the MyBlogLog community manager.

There are several changes that will happen in the not too distant future:

* There will be a re-branding of MyBlogLog and the exact timing and new brand are still unclear. There are thoughts by some that it may be called YahooBlogLog or MyYahooLog.
* A new website redesign is in the works.
* A new "Widget 2.0" is coming with some hover features.
* Offensive photos on MyBlogLog will also be removed so that it can be used on more conservative business blogs.
* Some sort of method to turn off your presence for some types of sites will be added.
