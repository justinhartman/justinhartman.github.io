It appears that if you have a lot of money you can be anti-competitive and illegal and get away with it by paying everyone off.

Microsoft have spent no less than $770-million paying off their competitors or squashing them by using brute force. The companies paid off to-date include: Netscape, Novell, Time Warner and Sun Microsystems... only RealNetworks (i.e. RealPlayer) are left in the pot. 

Microsoft again looking a lot like the Telkom of South Africa... what will it take to stop these guys?
