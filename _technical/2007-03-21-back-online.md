excerpt: So it's been almost two weeks but I'm finally back online. I've learnt the hard way that if you don't have RAID configured on your server you will lose everything if your hard drive packs up.

So it's been almost two weeks but I'm finally back online. I've learnt the hard way that if you don't have <a href="http://www.orafaq.com/glossary/faqglosr.htm">RAID</a> configured on your server you will lose everything if your hard drive packs up. A difficult lesson to learn but slowly picking up the pieces.

Grabble and others should be back online in the next couple hours/days...
