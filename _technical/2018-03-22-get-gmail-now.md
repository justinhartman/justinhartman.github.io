It took me nearly 6 months to crack an invite to get a Gmail email account and now I have found an even simpler way to get one. The <a href="http://isnoop.net/gmail/">isnoop.net gmail invite spooler</a> is a system where you can enter your current email address and you'll be sent an invite to get a Gmail account almost immediately. 

As of today there are 321,911 invites available and this increases and decreases daily. For those of you who don't know what Gmail is, read my previous blog entry to get an idea. I hope that this helps some of you get in touch with the future of email.
