Well times are certainly changing and the first conviction in the US for spam proves this. I know that laws have gotten tougher and it is a continual battle to combat the spam issue and I only hope that this helps change many peoples mind before doing so. 

Mind you, I have had my own personal share of spam in my day, I mean how is a small business supposed to develop into a large organisation without sending out a few unsolicited mails ?? :) 

Gone are these days and I feel the personal brunt of this with at least 10 to 15 spam mails a day...
