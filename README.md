## 1. Credits

- Jekyll: [jekyllrb.com][jekyll]
- Minimal Mistakes: [minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme][mm]
- [@mmistakes][mmistakes] has created a truly magnificent theme and to be honest, it inspired me to really put effort into my site. Without this theme I fear I would still be without a site. Thank you [@mmistakes][mmistakes].

## 2. Licenses

The source code for my website is broken up into three different licenses. I realise this may seem overkill but I have done this for the following reasons:

- **Theme:** The [Minimal Mistakes theme][mm] that I'm currently using on the site is released under the [MIT license][mit]. I must retain this license in both current and future versions of the site or until such time as I stop using the theme.
- **Content:** The content that I have written is released under a [Creative Commons NC-SA-4.0 license][by-nc-sa]. As the content is original and belongs entirely to me I have chosen this license as I believe it's the most appropriate to use for creative work that I want to share with the public.
- **Software:** Any code or software which I create and ends up being hosted in this repository will be released under the [GNU Affero General Public License - Version 3][agpl]. While the BY-NC-SA license is great for creative work, specifically written work, it doesn't fit the needs of software licensing requirements. As such, I prefer to release my code and software under the AGPLv3 license.
