# Justin Hartman Website
This repository contains the source code that runs my personal site @ [justin.hartman.me][site]. 

## Credits

* Jekyll: [jekyllrb.com][jekyll]
* Minimal Mistakes: [minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme][mm]
* [@mmistakes][mmistakes] has created a truly magnificent theme and to be honest, it inspired me to really put effort into my site. Without this theme I fear I would still be without a site. Thank you [@mmistakes][mmistakes].

## Licenses

The source code for my website is broken up into three different licenses. I realise this may seem overkill but I have done this for the following reasons:

1. **Theme:** The [Minimal Mistakes theme][mm] that I'm currently using on the site is released under the <a rel="license external" href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>. I must retain this license in both current and future versions of the site or until such time as I stop using the theme.

2. **Content:** The content that I have written is released under a <a rel="license external" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons NC-SA-4.0 license</a>. As the content is original and belongs entirely to me I have chosen this license as I believe it's the most appropriate to use for creative work that I want to share with the public.

3. **Software:** Any code or software which I create and ends up being hosted in this repository will be released under the <a rel="license external" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt">GNU Affero General Public License - Version 3</a>. While the BY-NC-SA license is great for creative work, specifically written work, it doesn't fit the needs of software licensing requirements. As such, I prefer to release my code and software under the AGPLv3 license.
