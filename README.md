This repo contains the source code that runs my personal site @ [justin.hartman.me][site]. 

## Credits

* Jekyll: [jekyllrb.com][jekyll]
* Minimal Mistakes: [minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme][mm]
* [@mmistakes][mmistakes] has created a truly magnificent theme and to be honest, it inspired me to really put effort into my site. Without this theme I fear I would still be without a site. Thank you [@mmistakes][mmistakes].
